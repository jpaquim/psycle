Q) 	When Psycle loses focus, the music stops. Why?
A) 	The "Exclusive" mode is selected in the Directsound Configuration.
	Go to Configuration Menu, settings option and there the "Input/output" folder, to
	press the configure button.There you will see the option.

Q)	I've put my xxx VST plugin in the "plugins" dir and Psycle doesn't show it. Why?
A)	Psycle uses a different paths for Native plugins and VST plugins.
	By default, Native Plugins go under "Plugins\" and VST's go under "Vst\".
	If you want to change it, go to Configure-Settings, there the "Directories" tab,
	and select your VST plugins' dir.

Q)	Why doesn't/Can't/won't Psycle support buzz machines?
A)	Oskari Tammelin, Buzz author, declined us the right to develop a Buzz Plugins' Host
	for Psycle. It's up to someone to develop a plugin that can load buzz plugins.
	(It won't be allowed by Oskari either, but many users would like it)

Q)	I Have Pro52 VSTi and it is shown as an Effect Machine. How come?
A)	There are two Pro5 dll's, one called pro-52.dll and the other called pro-52fx.dll
	The first one is recognized by Psycle as a generator while the other is recognized
	as an effect and it allows to use the Pro52 Effect engine separatedly from the synth

Q)	I can't enter notes into the Pattern Editor. What happens?
A)	The Edit Mode is Deactivated. The default key to switch it on/off is the "Space" key.
	Also, now you have a Red Dot next to the "Undo/Redo" buttons, which allows you to change it
	as well.

Q)	Psycle is opensource, how can I help developing it?
A)	You're welcome! Please read the README and HACKING files,
	and join us on irc!
