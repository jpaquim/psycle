<Center>Welcome to Psycle!</center> <P>

Psycle is a free, Open-Source, music creation program that offers an easy way to
create your own music, fast, and with high quality.<P>

Psycle uses a classical tracker interface (a text grid of notes which are
sequenced one after the other), coupled with modularity (plugins) that allow to
extend the sounds that you get from it.<P>

Notes are entered in <a href="PatternEd_Main.htm">patterns</a>, where you can also use commands (plugin specific,
or global), as well as automating parameters via the mcm and twk commands.
These patterns are then organized in a <a href="Bars_Sequencer.htm">linear sequence</a>, which becomes the
song order.<P>

It supports three ways to get new sounds: Its own native plugins, the VST Plugin
standard, and recorded .wav samples using the <a href="Sampler.htm">sampler machine</a>.<bR>
Also, since version 1.8.5, Psycle has a wave-in machine to capture sound live.<P>

 <P>
If this is your first time using Psycle, we recommend reading the <a href="Tutorial.htm">Tutorial</a>.  For more advanced help, browse through the sections for each part of the interface.<P>
Psycle is developed by the Psycledelics community, based at <a href="http://psycle.pastnotecut.org" target="_blank">http://psycle.pastnotecut.org</a>.  If you're interested in being involved in Psycle development, read the <a href="About_Involved.htm">Become Involved</a> section.
