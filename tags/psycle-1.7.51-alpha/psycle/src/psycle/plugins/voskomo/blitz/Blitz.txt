      - one of 21 Waveform Modulation Techniques
      - two LFO for Symmetry Control
      - 4x oversampling
      - Sync (possible as ring for all osc)
      - Phase Feedback

   2 RingModulators

   1 optional Filter with 10 Modes and Keytrack

   1 Arpeggiator with 12 Patterns, Shuffle,
     two optional types of Retrigger,
     special routing options for each Oscillator

   1 Vibrato LFO with routing

   brief explanation of some knobs

                      Arpeggiator Retrig 
   Off                   :  no retrig
   On                    :  retrig on new arp-note
   Even                  :  retrig every second arp-note


                      Oscillator n Options
   Off                   :  apply arpeggio and thats it
   Sync                  :  apply arpeggio and restart Osc if last Osc restarts
   Arpless Sync          :  dont apply arp but restart Osc if last Osc restarts
   Arp Note 1            :  dont apply arp
   Arp Note 2            :  dont apply arp and transpose with Arp Tone 2
   Arp Note 3            :  dont apply arp and transpose with Arp Tone 3
   Arp Note 4            :  dont apply arp and transpose with Arp Tone 4

                      Symmetry Drift

   makes varies the symmetry start position when playing a new note

                      Symmetry LFO

   makes the symmetry slide (initialized every new note)

                      Envelope Keyscaling

   makes the envelope speed up the higher the key is

                      Soften High Notes

   smoothes high notes by reducing volume (wanted by alk)

                      Stereo Switching

   places a new note either more left or more right

   ...............
   pattern effects
   ...............


   C1xx : Slide Up
   C2xx : Slide Down
   C3xx : Tone Portamento
   C4xx : Tone Portamento with Retrig
   C5xx : Interval (> 127 == minus)
   C6xx : Touchtaping (> 127 == minus)
   C7xx : Touchtaping with Retrig
   C8xx : Retrig Bits (1:Drift, 2:SyncVib, 4:FltVib)

          if u want to render the song always exactly the same,
          then initialize the synth with these bits.
          if u want to reset drift,syncvib and fltvib enter C807 (1+2+4=7)

   CCxx : Set Volume
   Dxyy : Semi Portamento (x tones down with rate yy)
   Exyy : Semi Portamento (x tones up with rate yy)
   BFFF and lower: Arpeggio (xyzz, x=2nd, y=3rd, zz=optional 4th tone)

          to make a normal tracker arpeggio enter f.e.  4700 (wich will make DUR)
          to make a arp of four tones use the last byte, like 470A or 4711

          dont forget that it is possible to play normal chords with this feature too,
          you just have to route the arp notes to the individual oscillators then.
