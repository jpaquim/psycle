<p class=head2>Wires and the Signal Analyser</p>
Machines are joined together by <b><i>wires</i></b>.  To connect two machines, right click the first machine and drag the wire from the first machine to the second. Alternatively, you can press the shift key, and the left mouse button. The triangle shows the direction of 'flow' of audio.  You can only connect a generator <b><i>TO</i></b> an effect, or an effect to an effect (if you try to do otherwise, you will get a "machine connection failed" message).
<P><center><img src="wire.png" alt="" border="0"></center>

<P>  To change the machine that a wire is connected to, right click the triangle and drag the wire to its new destination.  To change a wire's source, hold control, right click and drag in the same way.

<P>To display the connection volume and the signal analyser, double-click the white triangle.

The vertical slider is a simple volume slider - to set the volume, drag the slider or click on the percentage or decibel buttons and type in a new value.
<a name="analyser">
<P>The signal analyser provides you with a set of professional tools to help you make your tunes sound even better.  The button (below the graph) cycles through several different analysing modes:
<ul><li><b>Scope Mode:</b>  Displays the Left (coloured blue) and Right (green) volumes in decibels.
<li><b>Oscilloscope:</b>  Displays the Left and Right signals as a realtime waveform graph (same colours as Scope).
<li><b>Spectrum Analyser:</b>  Displays a realtime frequency band analysis, alternating left and right across the display e.g. in the above picture, the blue/pink lines are the left channel and the green lines are the right channel.
<li><b>Stereo Phase:</b>  Displays the stereo phase of the signal (essentially where the sound appears to be in 3D). Note:  The colours here are NOT left and right signals.
</ul>
The parameters (such as refresh rate, number or bands etc.) can be modified by dragging the two sliders.  To freeze the image, click the hold button.  Click the delete button to remove the wire.
<P>
The wire number is shown in brackets on the left-hand side of the title bar.  Wire numbers are associated with the machine the wire comes <b><i>FROM</i></b>.<P>
