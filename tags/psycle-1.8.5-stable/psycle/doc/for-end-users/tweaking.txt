- Controlling/Tweaking Generators and Effects
---------------------------------------------

	Tweaking a machine from the pattern is changing the value of its knobs to
	another one.
	This way, you can control the machine in realtime (playback).

	To do so, you use the TWEAK command. You see it like "twk" in the note Row.
	You can also use the TWEAK SMOOTH command.  It is displayed as "tws" in the
	note Row.

	"tws" differs from "twk" in the manner that "tws" smoothly alters the parameter
	from it's CURRENT position to the position during the time of one line in the
	pattern; "twk" happens instantaneously.  "twk" is useful for parameter changes
	and initializing knobs at the beginning of your songs, and uses very little
	overhead; "tws" is usefull for smooth filter sweeps, fades, swells, etc, as it
	essentially sends an interpolated twk command every 64 samples.


- How to insert the TWEAK or TWEAK SMOOTH command in the Pattern
------------------------------------------------

	If the following is a pattern Row,
           
	Description:   (1) (2)(3) (4)
	Pattern Row : ---- .. .. ....

	then, on (1) , you insert the TWEAK command. To do so, you should press the TWK key.
	When doing so, the word "twk" will appear.  There is a separate key for "tws".

	\\\	The twk key differs from different keyboard languages, but you can Configure
	///	it in the Keyboard Settings DialogBox (Configuration-Settings, and there the
		"Keyboard and Misc." tab)

	 
	On (2) , you define the Controller/Parameter you want to change. Later in this
 	document it is explained how you can know this number.

	On (3) , you specify the number of the Machine, just like you do to enter notes.
		This number is the one shown in the combobox, or in the machine's dialog.


	Finally, on (4), you specify the Value that the parameter will take. There are
	little differences between tweaking a Native Plugin and a VST plugin. Look further on
	this document to know them.

	Example:

		twk 05 42 0067  05 Indicates Parameter 05
				42 Indicates Effect Number 2
				0067 Indicates the value

	--> Psycle can fill tweaks for you, using its interpolate option. Put the start value at
	the start line, the end value in the end line, select all the rows between them plus them both
	and select Interpolate in the rightclick popup menu. This is very handy for smooth
	sweeps with tws.

	--> You can also make psycle record your tweaks live, either with mouse or MIDI:

	1) Go to the config/keyboard dialog, and make sure you have either tws checked if that
	is the mode you would like to record.  If you want to record twk commands instead, 
	uncheck it.

	2) Make sure you have "record tweaks" checked in the right under the sequencer.

	3.1) To record tweaks with mouse:

	* Open the gui for the machine you want to record tweaks from.

	3.2) To record tweaks with midi:

	*) Go to the Midi Controllers menu, and set up the controller and range of information
	that you want to record.  You will need to know the parameter number for the machine
	you are recording.
	If the (VST) machine allows it, you might preffer to use "Record RAW MIDI Commands".

	4) Go to the pattern editor and arm the track you want to record in. (Select the record button
	   on the track header)

	5) Make sure you're in edit mode (See the record button in the playback toolbar, or the word "Edit"
	    down right in the status bar).

	6) Press play and start tweaking.
	    
	    
- Knowing the Parameter number of a Machine
-------------------------------------------

	You have different ways to know the parameter number of one plugin.

	* The easiest one is selecting "Params" in the "MIDI/Params/Waves", combobox.
	  This way, the next combobox will be updated with the parameter list of the current
	  selected machine.
	  The selected number will automatically be added to the pattern when doing twk.

	You could also know it by:
	* With Native Machines:
	  Opening the parameters' windows and right clicking over the parameter you want to
	  change.This will pop up the "Tweaking" dialog.
	  On the titlebar of this dialog, you will see a number in HEX. This is the number
	  of the parameter.
	  Also, in this dialog, now you have a complete "twk" line that shows you the value
	  that you'd use to set this parameter to the current value.

	* With VST plugins:
	  Opening the parameters' window, you have the option to show the parameters list
	  via the "View" Menu. This will popup a window with a list of the parameters 
	  numbered in HEX. This is the number you need.


- Knowing the Right Value
-------------------------

	There are differences between VST plugins, Psycle plugins and internal plugins:

	* VST Plugins:

	  They have a fixed range. 0 is the smallest value, and FFFF is the biggest.

	* Psycle Native Plugins:

	  They have a range defined by the knob. You need to move the knob to the
	  desired position and right click over it to open the "Tweaking" dialog, which shows
	  you an editbox to put a value manually, and also a complete "twk" line that
	  you'd use to set this parameter to this value.

	  Advise: As you'd see, if the knob's minimum value is not zero (Like, with the VCF Envmod), 
	  0 = min value

	* Psycle Internal machines: 
	  Use the same procedure than with Native plugins.


- Mcm Command. Use MIDI CC's to control VST Plugins
-----------------------------------------------

	The Mcm command works in a similar way than the Twk Command:

	If the following is a pattern Row,
           
	Description:   (1) (2)(3) (4)
	Pattern Row : --- .. .. ....

	then, on (1) , you insert the Mcm command.
	To do so, you should press Mcm key. Check and/or change its value in the Keyboard
	Configuration dialog (Configuration-settings).

	On (2) , you define the Midi command number that you want to send.
	You might need to check some MIDI documents and/or the Plugin's help to know what
	to write in here.

	On (3) , you specify the number of the Machine, just like you do with tweaks.
		This number is the one shown in the combobox, or in the machine's dialog.

	Finally, on (4), you specify the Value to send for this midi command.
	
	(4) is divided in two groups of two values AABB.
	Some commands might only need AA.

	Usually, you'll use it to send midi CC's. CC Command is "B0".
	Example, this sets the machine volume to half of it:

		Mcm B0 01 0740
				B0 Send a midi CC (Control Change) command (MIDI channel 1)
				01 to the Generator number 1
				07 in order to change CC7 (channel volume on most synths)
				40 to 40 (in a scale of 0 to 7F, HEX)
				

- Mcm Command with Native plugins. Send a command to a desired channel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

	The Mcm command can also be used for another purpose with Native plugins.
	It allows to send a command to another channel. This way, you can workaround
	the limitation where you can only put one of them per channel.
	
	Syntax is as follows:
	
	If the following is a pattern Row,
           
	Description:   (1) (2)(3) (4)
	Pattern Row : ---- .. .. ....

	on (1) , you insert the Mcm command.
	on (2), insert the channel (track) number where the command will be sent to.
	on (3), insert the machine number
	on (4), insert the command that you want to send.
	
	Example: Send command 0C50 to channel 02 of machine 06:
	
		mcm 02 06 0C50
	

- Pattern Commands
------------------

	Psycle also allows to use some "old school" commands in the command row.
	The currently supported ones are:


	* Global/Tracker Commands: 

	  FFxx	-	Change BPM
	  FExx	-	Extended command:
	  	FE0x
	  	FE1x 	Change Tick Per Beat
	  	FE2x	Set Bypass ( 0 off, else on)
	  	FE3x	Set Mute (0 off, else on)
	  	FEBx	Set Pattern Loop ( FEB0 set loop start, FEBx number of loops)
	  	FEDx	Set Pattern Delay. ( x = number of lines+1 )
	  	FEFx	Set Pattern Fine delay in ticks ( lines = 1+((ticks*linesperbeat)/24) )
	  	
	  FDxx  -	Delay Trigger (xx/256 ticks) (works with noteoffs too)
	  FCxx	-	Change Global/Wire Volume
			Examples:
			--- .. .. FC80	Sets Global Volume to the half.
			--- 01 05 FC40	Sets Wire 1 of GENERATOR 5 to volume 40 (1/4th)
			--- 01 45 FC30	Sets Wire 1 of EFFECT 5 to volume 30.

			Aux column indicates the wire number.
			It is shown in the _title_ of the wire Dialog.
	  
	  FBxx	-	Retrigger (xx/256 ticks duration per trigger)
	  FAxy  -	Retrigger Continue (x/16 = ticks duration per trigger, 
				0 = use current) (y = acceleration, 1-8 pos, 9-f negative
				f is the slowest negative acceleration, 1 is slowest 
				positive acceleration) * does not trigger on new line, rather
				continues from previous retrigger position
	  F8xx	-	Sets the indicated Machine's Panning
			Example:
			--- .. 05 F880 Sets the panning of Generator 5 to 80 (Middle)
	  F3xx 	-	Jump to sequence order number xx.
	  F2xx	-	Jump to next sequence order, and to the line xx.

	* VST Commands:
	
	  0Cxx	-	Set volume ( Velocity on noteon, Expression otherwise )
	  
	  C1xx 	-	Set pitch bend range of the VST.
	  C2xx 	-	Panning position for the midi channel.
	  C3xx	- 	Slide to note with speed xx.
	  Dxyy	-	Pitch slide down x number of semis, yy speed.
	  Exyy	-	Pitch slide up x number of semis, yy speed.

	  10xx	-	_OLD_ MIDI Command. Not documented anymore. Use the "Mcm" command.
	  
	  NOTE : 	If your VST supports legato, this effect can be triggered leaving the machine index empty:
	  
	  		Example: 
	  		
	  		C-5 00 02 ....
	  		... .. .. ....
	  		E-5 00 .. ....	<- this note legates (does not stop previous)
	  		
	  		
	* Sampler Commands:

	  01xx	-	Portamento Up
	  02xx	-	Portamento Down
	  08xx	-	Set panning position

	  0Cxx	-	Set volume
	  0ECx	-	Note cut in x frames
	  0EDx	-	Note delay in x frames
	  15xy	-	Retrig Command. y = Number of retrigs (1 = do one retrig)
			-	x changes the volume in the following way:
				0 or 8 : No change
				1: +1		9:  -1
				2: +2		A: -2
				3: +4		B: -4
				4: +8		C: -8
				5: +16		D: -16
