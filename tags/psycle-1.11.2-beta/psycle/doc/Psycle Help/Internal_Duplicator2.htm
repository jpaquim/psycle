<p class="head2">Split and dupe</p>
The split and dupe machine is an extension of note duplicator with more 
machines and with the ability to split the keyboard and use only some machines 
on some notes.
This makes this one better for layered setups, like using a machine for notes
under a certain octave, while switching to others when increasing it.<br />
It is also useful to make a virtual split of a midi keyboard.
<p />

<p>The different machines are selected on the left-side, and the note offset
(note transpose) is selected on the second column (0 semitones means it doesn't change the note). 
The third and fourth column select the range of notes in which this machine will be used.
</p>
<p>All of
these machines can then be played simultaneously by using the Note
Duplicator as a generator - either by playing notes through it in real
time or entering notes in the <a href="PatternEditor.htm">Pattern
Editor</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Note Duplicator can also be muted or soloed (soloing this
machine will mean that no sound is produced at all, since it only sends
messages to <i><b>OTHER</b></i> machines).</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> This machine does not need to be connected to any
other machines to work.</p>
