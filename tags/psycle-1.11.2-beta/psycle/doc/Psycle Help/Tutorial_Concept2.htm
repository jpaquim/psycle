<p class="head2">Psycle Concept No. 2</p>

Now that you've got your sounds working, it's time to enter some notes
to make a proper song. To open the pattern window, press F3,
<b><i>OR</i></b>
the pattern editor button in the toolbar
<b><i>OR</i></b>
go to the menu
<i>View &gt; Pattern Editor</i>
. A Psycle song consists of patterns which are then sequenced. A pattern
is made up of rows and tracks.
<p><img src="patterneditor.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Each row corresponds to a time interval. With the default
Line-per-beat setting of 4, that means that every row corresponds to a
dem-semi-quaver, or 16th-note. However, this does not mean that a note
is restricted to a 16th-note duration - that depends on the settings of
the generator and Note-Off commands. It is analogous to having a piano
score with every note and rest written out as tied 16th notes (or
whatever time interval applies).</p>
<p>Each track is like channels on a mixer - it allows notes from
different generators to be played simultaneously.</p>
<p class="head2">Entering Notes</p>
Now you're in the pattern window, it's time to enter some notes.
Firstly, some explanation of the format of the notes is needed. Each
entry for a note looks like this:

<p />
<center><code> --- .. .. .... <br />

C-4 01 00 0D7F <br />

A-3 .. 00 .... </code></center>

<p>Psycle uses the English notation for the note names (See <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note">Wikipedia</a> to see the
correspondence with other notations). This notation uses the first 7
letters of the alphabet as notes.</p>
<p>For now, all you really need to know about is the note name (e.g.
C-4) and the generator number (3rd column) which are pretty much self
explanatory once you know where they are. Now, to enter some notes, go
to a track and click on the part of a note entry position where the
note-name goes. Now, press Q, down arrow, W, down arrow, E, down arrow.
You should see several notes there. Notice that the machine number is
automatically entered by Psycle. It uses the generator selected in the
machine combobox (in the toolbar).</p>
<p>The default mapping puts two octaves in a computer keyboard like
what is shown in this image<br />
<img src="640px-Psycle_keyboard.jpg" /></p>
<p>You can check and modify which keyboard keys correspond to each
musical key in the <a href="Config_Keyboard.htm">keyboard section</a> of
the configuration</p>
<p>If you're using samples, the only difference in playing notes is
that the sample number (which is the other combobox in the toolbar) is
shown in the second column e.g.</p>
<p />
<center><code> C-4 02 01 .... <br />

</code></center>


<p>where the sample number is 02 and the generator number is 01.</p>
<br />
A special key to be aware of is the "Note Off" key, which sends a
"noteoff" message to the specified generator, allowing you to decide
when to stop a playing note. Press the key "1" above the QWERTY keys.
You would see a text like like this:
<br />

<center><code> off .. 00 .... </code></center>
<p>Note: You might need to change the Envelope values ( amp
envelope, VCA envelope...)&nbsp;of the machine to get the duration that
you search for.</p>
<p class="head2">The sequence: How to play more patterns</p>
<p>A pattern can have many lines and tracks, but a single pattern is
not meant to hold an entire song. For that, there is the sequence.<br />
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="sequence-numbers.png" /></td>
		<td valign="top">
		<p>The sequence, as the name implies is where you can indicate
		which patterns will play, and in which order. Psycle supports up to
		256 patterns and up to 256 positions in the sequence.<br />
		On the left, there is a sequence showing pattern numbers. This is seen
		as 00:00. The pair before the semicolon ":" indicates the position of
		the sequence. The pair after the semicolon indicates the number of the
		pattern.<br />
		</p>
		<p>In Psycle, the pattern you are editing is always the pattern
		that is selected in the sequence. To add a new one, press the New
		button. You will see that the sequence increments in one position, and
		that the pattern is empty. Fill in some more notes.<br />
		There are two more ways to increment the sequence length. If you press
		the Ins button, the sequence will increase, but it will add the same
		pattern number than the one you are editing. In this way, you can
		repeat a pattern without needing to write it again (See positions 09,
		0A and 0B).<br />
		Finally, the other way to increase the sequence length is the Clone
		button. If you press the button, the sequence increases, adds a new
		pattern and fills it with a copy of what the current pattern has. This
		is interesting when you want to do a variation of the current pattern
		like adding or removing tracks and/or notes.<br />
		</p>
		<p>The other two buttons, the plus and minus, will change the
		pattern index adding or removing one to its value. The sequence popup
		menu allows other changes</p>
		<p>Finally, on the right side, there is the sequence with named
		patterns. The checkbox named "Show pattern names" on the bottom side
		is responsible for switching this. You can name patterns
		right-clicking on the pattern position in the sequence, or using
		control+enter in the pattern, or selecting the pattern properties
		option in the pattern popup menu.</p>
