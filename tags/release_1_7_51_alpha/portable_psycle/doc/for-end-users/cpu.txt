This pack contains separate directories for each type of CPU.
Each of them contains the psycle host application, and all the open source native plugins,
specially targeted to run best on a particular type of CPU.

There are currently two directories:

	- the G7 directory, for "recent" AMD and Intel CPUs:
		- G7:
			AMD Athlon and early Duron.
		- G7-SSE:
			AMD: Athlon XP, late Duron, Athlon 64, Athlon FX,
			Intel: Pentium 4, Celeron Pentium 4, Pentium M Centrino

	- the G6 directory, for "old" Intel CPUs:
		- G6:
			Intel Pentium Pro, Pentium II, and early Celeron.
		- G6-SSE:
			Intel Pentium III and Celeron Pentium III.

You should copy everything contained in the directory that matches your cpu into the psycle directory.
Make sure you don't have duplicates of the same plugins:
	the packs from psycledelics puts the plugins into subdirs of the plugins dir,
	and this pack does have them all at the top of the plugins dir.
	(Actually, it could happen in future plugins that subdirectories cause problems.)

Currently, we don't distribute builds for older CPUs, G5: Intel Pentium I, AMD K6, K6-2, K6-III, 5x86, 6x86, etc.
If you request us to add it, we'll add it.

At the time of this writing, AMD Athlon 64/FX and Intel IA-64 are not yet widely used,
and we don't have tools to make builds for these CPUs.
