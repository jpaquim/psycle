<p class=head2>Recording in real-time</P>
To record in real-time, <a href="PatternEd_Notes.htm">recording</a> must be selected.  As well as notes, tweaks can be recorded in real time, however the <a href="PatternEd_Settings.htm#sequence">Record Tweaks</a> checkbox on the sequencer bar must be ticked.
<P>
To record multiple notes at once (e.g. chords), you need to "arm" the current track - in other words, select the record button on the header of each track.  Do this for every track that you want the notes/tweaks/mcm commands to appear in.
<P>

Then, to record, press play (F5) and enter your notes or move the knobs on your machines.

If you only want to record notes in one track, you don't need to arm the track, provided the "FT2 Style Record Behaviour in Unarmed Track" option is ticked in the <a href="Config_Keyboard.htm">Configuration</a> window.
