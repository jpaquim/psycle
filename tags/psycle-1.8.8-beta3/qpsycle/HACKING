HACKING ON QPSYCLE
==================

These are some tips & guidelines to bear in mind when coding
in qpsycle.


Getting started
---------------

A good way to get started is to build and compile the
program then spend some time playing around with it,
trying to build a song, and making a note of any bugs
and omissions that you notice.  Then, add 
those to the bug tracker.  Then have a look at the 
code and see if you think you can resolve any of them
(or anything else on the bug tracker, for that matter :)

Hopefully in future we may some more useful documents
and diagrams to give an overview of the system.


Avoiding duplication of work
----------------------------

Before you start working on something, it is a good
idea to check the bug tracker to see whether someone
else has already started working on that task.  This can help
to avoid two people duplicating each others' work.


include files
-------------

In the GUI files, include psycore files first, followed by
other GUI files, followed by standard library includes,
followed by Qt includes.

For example:

#include <psycore/song.h>

#include "machineview/machineview.h"

#include <map>

#include <QLabel>

psycore has to go before Qt due to a conflict between
boost::signals and Qt.


Adding yourself as an author
----------------------------

If you add some code to qpsycle, please feel free to add your 
name to the AUTHORS file with a note of what you added.  Don't
put your name in the actual code file; noone owns a particular
piece of code, and it can sometimes put other potentional developers 
off working on something if they think it "belongs" to someone else.

(p.s. putting your name in for little notes, queries, etc,
related to part of the code is fine -- just don't put AUTHOR = ME
in big letters at the top.)


Places to get general tips and advice
-------------------------------------

Regarding host/Qt: qtcentre.org is a very helpful forum for all kinds
of Qt related questions.  You could also try asking mutilus on #psycle
if he's around :)

Regarding psycore: JosepMa is the man in the know here.
