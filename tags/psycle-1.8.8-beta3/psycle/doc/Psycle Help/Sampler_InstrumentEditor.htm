Use the arrow buttons to switch between samples, the textbox to rename them, and the "Kill" button to delete them.

<p class=head3>Instrument Properties</P>

<b>New Note Action</b> &ndash; Whether to cut, release or do nothing when another note from the same machine is triggered while the previous note is still playing.<P>
<b>Panning</b> &ndash; The left or right channel bias of the sample.  128 is the middle. <P>
<b>Random Panning</b> &ndash; Randomises the panning each time the sample is played.<P>
<b>Random VCF Cutoff</b> &ndash; Randomises the <a href="#filter">filter</a> cutoff each time the sample is played.<P>
<b>Random Reso/Bw.</b> &ndash; Randomises the resonance of the filter each time the sample is played.

<p class=head3>Tempo Looping Tool</P>

<b>Play sample to fit X rows</b> &ndash; Stretches or squashes the sample to fit a given number of rows.
<a name="wavelayer">
<p class=head3>Instrument Wave Layer</P>

<b>Volume</b> &ndash; Volume of the sample.<P>
<b>FineTune</b> &ndash; Finetuning of the pitch of the sample by a maximum of +/- one semitone.<P>
<b>Tune</b> &ndash; Sets the base tuning of the note.  The original pitch of the sample is set to C-4, so if the tuning of a given sample were set to C-5, the pitch of the sample is shifted up by one octave.<P>
<b>Loop</b> &ndash; To turn on the loop set in the <a href="Sampler_WaveEditor.htm">wave editor</a>, click "Forward".  Click the "Off" button to turn ignore the loop settings.<P>
<b>Loop At</b> &ndash; Displays the loop points that have been set in the <a href="Sampler_WaveEditor.htm">wave editor</a>.

<p class=head3>Amplitude/Filter Envelopes</P>

(click on the Amplitude/Filter Envelopes button)<P>
<b>Amplitude</b> &ndash; This modifies the ADSR (Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release) envelope for the volume, which is shown on a graph.  To ignore the volume settings, set the Attack, Decay and Release to the lowest value possible, and set the Sustain to 100%.
<P>
<a name="filter">
<b>Filter</b> &ndash; This modifies the ADSR envelope for the filter.<P>
<b>Filter Parameters</b> &ndash; This allows you to set the filter cut-off frequency, the Q (resonance) and the percentage effect of the filter envelope on the sample.<P>
<b>Filter Mode</b> &ndash; This allows you to set the filter type.  You have a choice of Low Pass (retains only the freqencies below the cufoff), High Pass (retains only the freqencies above the cutoff), Band Pass (retains only a band of frequencies above and below the cutoff) and Notch (rejects only a band of frequencies above and below the cutoff).  To ignore any filter settings, set this to "None".<P>
