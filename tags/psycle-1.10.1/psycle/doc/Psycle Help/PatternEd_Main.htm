<p class="head2">How the Pattern Editor Works</p>

The pattern editor is where you enter your music notes, percussion, and
any other sounds you want to produce. It consists of tracks, rows and
columns.
<p>A <b><i>pattern</i></b> is a small section of your song which is
placed in sequence with other patterns, in the <a
	href="SequenceEditor.htm">Sequence Editor</a>.</p>
<p>A <b><i>track</i></b> is one of the major vertical subdivisions
in the pattern window. It is analogous to channels on a mixer - on each
row in each track, only one note can play at a time (which is why there
are multiple tracks).</p>
<p />

<p>The blue button on the left of the track number lits when the track outputs audio. This is a guess based on the plugin making sound, since this information is not available from the plugins. Only the Sampler and XMSampler internal machines will make this led lit accurately.<br/>
Some skins might not have this button.</p>
<p>The orange, green and red buttons on the right of the track number stand for <a href="PatternEd_Record.htm">record</a>,
solo and mute, and apply to the track directly below.</p>
<p>Entering music notes in Psycle is quite different from a music
staff or piano roll (see the <a href="PatternEd_Notes.htm">Entering
Notes</a> section). If you are familiar with trackers you should have no
problems at all, and even if you aren't, the interface isn't too hard to
learn. Commands to alter the parameters of machines (<a
	href="PatternEd_Tweak.htm">parameter automation</a>), are also entered
in the Pattern Editor.</p>
<p>An important thing to note is that in the Pattern Editor, <b><i>hexadecimal</i></b>
notation is used to specify numbers - instead of digits going <code>0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9</code>,
they go <code>0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-A-B-C-D-E-F</code>.</p>
<p><a name="record"><b>Note:</b> To enter any notes or other commands, the recording
button</a> (<img src="record.png" align="middle" />) in the <a href="Bars_Toolbar.htm">Toolbar</a>
must be enabled, otherwise patterns cannot be edited.</p>
