<p class="head2">Recording in real-time</p>
<p>This section of the help file talks about entering data into the
patterns in realtime. If you look for recording the audio in real-time,
see the Record Wav button in the
<a href="Bars_Toolbar.htm">toolbar</a>.</p>
This operation requires that <a href="Bars_Toolbar.htm">Pattern recording</a>
is selected in the toolbar. 
<p>To record multiple notes at once (e.g. chords), you need to "arm"
the current track - in other words, select the record button on the
header of each track (The orange led in the default skin). Do this for every track that you want the
notes/tweaks/mcm commands to appear in.</p>
<p />
<center><img src="header.png"  /></center>
<p>
If you only want to record notes in one track,
you don't need to arm the track, provided the "FT2 Style Record
Behaviour in Unarmed Track" option is ticked in the <a
	href="Config_Keyboard.htm">Configuration</a> window.
</p>

<p>Then, to record, press play (F5) and play the notes with either the PC or MIDI keyboard or move the
knobs on your machines.<br/>
Remember that the <a href="PatternEd_Settings.htm#sequence">Record Tweaks</a>
checkbox on the sequencer bar must be ticked for tweaks to be recorded, and that
 <a href="PatternEd_Settings.htm#sequence">Record noteoff</a> is needed to record the release of the note.
