-- Psycle 1.67 (If it Comes. If not, many of these will come with Psycle 2) --
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Sampler Machine/Wave Ed:
--------------------------
	bug: 	 portamento to note slides too much. (can anyone test this for me?)
	feature: just have an checkbox to enable or disable the Amplitude, or the whole synthesis (phongshade)
	feature: Instruments Support ( *.xi , *.iti. Maybe more)
		 * samples mapped by key
		 * maybe: samples mapped by velocity?
	feature: Improve Filter support.
		 * twk Control
		 * maybe: allow filter cutoff/res mapping to velocity
	feature: volume slides/arpeggio
	feature: ability to set loop points. (+ ping-pong loops)
	feature: Easier way to load Samples.
	feature: Toolbar for the Wave Editor.
	feature: Note playback in WaveEd (Problem: Needs a sampler Machine. The wave preview is not adecuated)

* GUI (pattern):
----------------
	bug:	 Select with mouse when playing gives problems
	feature: FT2 Jumps to the top of a pattern when you move from one to another (Kris)
	feature: Another option would be turning off mouse move cursor, I liked being able to select something
		 and instantly copy it to where i have the cursor (Kris)
	feature: maybe: MultiPattern View (The code is not made in the best way)
	feature: Easier way to select patterns (having +-10 steps) 
	feature: Better key navigation in patterns. When editing a new pattern, create it and put it on the sequence.
	feature: MORE Keyboard shortcuts 

* GUI (machines):
-----------------
	feature: Saving all the missing settings to registry (like follow song, class of plugin..)
	feature: Clone Machine Button
	feature: Replace Machine by another.
	feature: Prevent duplicate names when creating Machines ( FeedMe , FeedMe 2...)
	feature: Directories in "Add new machine" (Sorting with directories)
		 Remember previous used and add "class/type" selection to registry
	feature: Internal Fx Gui to Native Gui Conversion (including wiredialog)
		 Create a new "universal" MachineFrame class, for all plugins
		 (Needs a few more changes in the class definitions)
	feature: Center Parameters window 
	feature: VST/Native machine Windows : ESC = close (Problem: can't close within the CWnd!!!)
	feature: VST: support for plugin resize. (Problem: Needs to know the View Class!)
	feature: VST param highlight when modifying.
		 When changing a param with the Graphic VST GUI, select the corresponding param in
		 the list (and update the bar as well). When,which, and to which value can be
		 known using the audioMasterCallback (Problem: Needs to know the View Class!)
	bug:	 VST: Changing a parameter, changing to another window, and returning to Psycle causes
		 that parameter to get the old value again (Scrollbar problem. Solution: Update the scrollbar)
	bug: 	 VST: Param value+1 when selecting (Scrollbar precision)
	feature: Option to hide Parameters in VST GUI.
	feature: Add Presets in a "tab" under Parameters (easy switching/testing)!
	bug:     Crash bug when loading a big .fxb file, problem with deleting, etc...  (Rep. by Vibra)
		 Fix:Basically, make ONLY .fxb for VST's.
	feature: Really good looking new Master Machine.(Graphics under res\MasterMachine)
	bug:	 JMDrum is buggy (Crashes sometimes)


* Player Engine:
----------------
	bug: 	 In some rare cases, when opening a song, psycle produces noise.
		 (See spiritualized.psy. Open, play, reopen -> bug. Not always!) Weird bug. Can't say more.
	bug:	 "MidiInput.cpp(359): warning #68: integer conversion resulted in a change of sign"
	bug:	 plugins which make use of the "SaveData" (native) or "SaveChunk" (VST’) can cause a crash if they are
		 missing when you load a song. Won’t get fixed by now. Needs a fileformat change.
	bug:	 New Note in Quadrasid does not reinitialize the Envelope. (Bug? This doesn't happen on freebase)
	bug:	 DirectSound Output is a bit buggy.Crashes and bad sound reported. 
		 ->Won’t Fix. Waiting for new code for Psycle 2<-
	feature: Maybe: New command "twc" which will send a machine command (like note delay, to say a silly one)
		 to the machine indicated by gen, and ___>to_the_channel_indicated_by_"inst"<____!
		 (asked by Pikari)
	feature: pattern repeat (loop) and song repeat (asked by Vir|us)
	feature: Note Delay to VST's


* Importing:
------------

	bug: It doesn't add the machines necessary to play all notes.
	bug: if you import an XM file and save, the finetune of the samples is not saved (Fileformat limitation)
	feature: Add option for the user to create samplers for instruments
	feature: IT importing

	? Time signatures

* Machines :
------------

	* the morphing fft-filter machine!!!! http://psycle.pastnotecut.org/thread.php?threadid=39&boardid=1&styleid=1
	* Multiple Inputs/Outputs
	* MIDI generator - instead of generating audio, generates MIDI out - sync could be an issue.

	* Compressor/limiter
	* Flanger/Chorus

* Audio/Control:
----------------

	* ASIO driver I/O
	* audio record support (Like, from microphone)
	* "MIDI Controlling <-> Machine <-> Machine" Interface = MIDI mapping
	  (allow to map midi commands to change different parameters)

	* Ogg/Winamp Plugin export?
