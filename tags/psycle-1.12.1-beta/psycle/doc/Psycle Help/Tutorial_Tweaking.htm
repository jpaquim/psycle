<p class="head2">Tweaking</p>

By now you should know how to make a simple song. But what about
automating parameter changes? (just think of those filter sweeps you've
heard in commercial tracks). This is where the "Tweak" and "Tweak
Smooth" commands come in. These can be inserted in patterns exactly like
notes, but instead of the note-name, you will see "twk" and "tws".
Here's how they work:
<p />

<center><code> twk 01 00 0D7F<br />

tws 01 00 0D7F </code>
<p />

</center>

The 2nd column is the parameter number, the 3rd column is the machine
number, and the 4th is the parameter value (i.e. your change).
<p>But how do you actually use this? Continuing on with our file
from earlier, go to the pattern view (if you're not already in it) and
enter a bunch of notes in the first track, going right down to the end.
Now, above the pattern window you'll see a toolbar with several
drop-down boxes. Make sure the second one says "00: Arguru Synth", the
third "Params" and then make the fourth "0F: VCF Cutoff". These
correspond to the third and second columns in the twk or tws command
(yes, they're back-to-front). The difference between "Tweak" and "Tweak
Smooth" is self explanatory.</p>

<p>Now, let's use this to create a filter sweep with our generator
we added earlier. Go to the second track of your pattern, click on the
note-name part of the first note entry position. While holding Control
(for Smooth twk), press the "`" or "~" key and release (if you're using
a non-english keyboard, it might be the key to the left of the "1". Use
the keyboard configuration settings if you can't find it). You should
see a tws entry like this:</p>

<p />

<center><code> tws 0F 00 0000 </code>
<p />

</center>

<p>Change the "0000" to "00FF" and then go to the last note in the
same track, and create another tws entry, this time making the value
"0053" (tws 0F 00 0053).<br />
Now, here's the shortcut - instead of typing each in-between value for
the filter sweep, we can interpolate. Select the whole track by clicking
and dragging from the top to the bottom or vice versa, right click, and
from the menu select "Interpolate (Linear)". Now, press Play (F5).
Congratulations, you've done your first filter sweep in Psycle!</p>
