	The IRC channel #psycle in EFnet still exists, but it is not actively used by
	developers right now.
</p>

<p><b>Q)</b>Is it possible to import/load MOD/S3M/XM/IT files into
Psycle?<br />

<b>A)</b> The ability to import has existed since version 1.8, but with an incomplete Sampulse machine.
	Since version 1.11.1 beta, the Sampulse machine is considered ready and can be used
	without fear for making songs.<br />
<br />
	Note that Psycle has a limitation : It does not have a volume column by default.<br />
	There are two ways to compensate for this. Use Virtual Generators for the sampled instruments, and then
	the aux column will be a volume column.<br />
	Else, use the mcm command in conjunction with the 1Exx command (Sampulse) or 0Cxx command (Sampler) to have both
	an effect command and a volume command.
</p>

<p><b>Q)</b> What is this 'dummy' machine?<br />

<b>A)</b> Dummy internal machine? It is mainly used to replace missing
plugin machines when loading a .psy file. It can also be used to group
machines, connecting them to it, and avoid a limitation that exists of
max 12 machines connected to one.</p>

<p><b>Q)</b> I have problems playing a song in Winamp!<br />

<b>A)</b> The last update of the plugin was for version 1.10.2. Also, remember that the plugin uses 
    its own plugin cache, which you'll have to regenerate from its own UI.</p>

<p class="head3"><b>Samples and the Sampler Machine</b></p>

<p><b>Q)</b> I've loaded a sample but it doesn't make any sound.<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> To play a sampled sound (.wav, .aiff, .iff/svx, .s3i or .its)
 you need to add a sampler machine and connect it to the
master or to an effect that goes to the master. You might want to check
if other machines make sound, and check your audio settings.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> Can Psycle use
OGG?/MP3? files as samples?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> Unfortunately not. This is a
common question, because it would be good. Support for lossy compression
(MP3?, etc) and lossless compression? (FLAC, etc) formats is on the TODO
list.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> When I load a sample
and enter a note, it's really fast and high-pitched when it plays. I've tried everything from halving the bit rate of the
sample to re-installing Psycle. What should I do about this?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> The way trackers change pitch
of a sample is by speeding up or slowing down the rate at which the
individual sample points are played back. The result is similar to
playing a 33 1/3 RPM record at 45, or vice versa.<br />

This depends on the note you press, the sample rate specified in the 
sampler (see the instruments editor window) and one setting in the Sampler machine changes between
C-4 or C-5 for the default speed note. Also, you can adjust the base
note to another value, via the Edit instruments screen (Edit button in the toolbar, or F10 key) </p>

<p class="head3"><b>Psycle Usage</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> I've put my xxx VST
plugin in the "plugins" dir and Psycle doesn't show it!<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> Psycle uses a different paths
for Native plugins and VST plugins. By default, Native Plugins go under
"Plugins\" and VST's go under "Vst\".<br />

If you want to change it, go to Configure-Settings, select the
"Directories" tab, and select your VST plugins' dir.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> What is the difference between the 32bits
and 64bits builds, and what implications does it have when using VST plugins?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span>The 64bits version of Psycle is
made for users of the 64bits of Windows. Both the 32 and 64bits can be used in these OSs,
but there is a restriction: The 64bits version can only load 64bit versions of VST plugins
and the 32bits can only load 32bit versions of them.<br/>
If you use a VST bit bridging, like <a href="http://jstuff.wordpress.com/jbridge/" target="_blank">jBridge</a>,
then that software can allow to use 32bits on 64bit version and 64bit on 32bit version.<br/>
Remember to activate the support in Psycle Directories settings.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> Why
doesn't/Can't/won't Psycle support buzz machines?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> Oskari Tammelin, the author
of Buzz, declined us the right to develop a Buzz Plugins' Host for
Psycle.<br />

Recently, some wrappers are being developed for other projects. Psycle
is keeping an eye on those and in the future we could use one of those
in it</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> I can't enter notes
into the Pattern Editor. What happens?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> The Edit Mode is Deactivated.
The default key to switch it on/off is the "Space" key. You can see if
you are on Edit mode in the status bar, to the right.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> What is the Red Circle
Button in the toolbar for?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> It allows you to enter Record
Notes in realtime mode.<br />

To enter this mode Follow Song and Edit mode have to be activated so
when you enable Record Notes in realtime, Follow Song and Edit mode are
activated automatically if they were disabled.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> I have only 16 tracks
in my psycle song, how do i get 64?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> Under the save icon (the
diskette), there is a track number selector. Unfold the list of tracks
number and select 64.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> What does the&nbsp;<span
	style="font-style: italic;">Autostop All Machines</span> button exactly
do?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> When enabled, if Psycle
detects an effect that receives no sound input, it stops it, freeing CPU
usage. This is beneficial in most cases, but plugins like delays, or
those that have LFO's or any other parameter that needs to run
constantly, will sound unexpectedly.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> How do I change the
pattern length?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> Right Click in the Pattern
Window and then select&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Properties.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> Is it possible to
have&nbsp;patterns with different lengths?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> See above: "How do I change
the pattern length?"</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> How does the
tweak_smooth command work?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> In the docs-Directory you
find a .txt-file with in-depth info about tweaking.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> Is it possible to let
a tws command affect several rows (not only one)?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> Smooth tweaks between two
tweak values can be achieved by entering the start and the end value,
selecting via mouse the region and then select "Interpolate" from the
context-menu.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> how do I stop a synth
playing in a track/ how do i create a NoteOff?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> put the cursor in a channel's
first column, the row you want it to stop and press&nbsp;1. This will
put an "off", silencing the machine at that point. You can also press
Ctrl+1 to insert an off without machine number, so that the last machine
used in this track would be stopped.<br />

<p class="head3"><b>Development</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> How can I develop a
Psycle Machine?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> There is no SDK yet, and
format will change in Psycle 2.<br />

The recommended way right now is to get the source directly of one of
the open source plugins ( arguru synth is a good start ), and use it as
a template for your own. You can download them from Psycle's SVN
repository at Source Forge Site:
https://psycle.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/psycle/trunk/psycle-plugins/</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> How can I port a Buzz
machine to Psycle?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> An old SDK exists in the
download section of Psycle in Sourceforge, but it is obsolete. The only
way there is right now is starting with a Psycle plugin.<br />

M3 Would be your start point, since it is partially documented.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> I would like to
contribute to the project. What can I do?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> Psycle evolves continuously,
and sometimes it is thanks small contributions from people not involved
directly with it. You can contact the developers (See first Question of
this FAQ) and ask what could you do, or tell us what you'd like to work
on instead: DSP, plugins, help files, graphics, tracker features...
There are lots of places that can be improved in one way or another.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span> When will Psycle 2 be
out?/ In which stage is Psycle 2 developement? What do you plan for
Psycle 2?<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> See the <a
