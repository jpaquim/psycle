<p class="head1">Using sampled sounds in Psycle with one of the internal machines</p>
<p>
Psycle is made around the concept of audio generators (machines), which usually
generate audio by themselves depending on the settings.<br />
But sometimes, recorded or sampled audio is desired, and Psycle offers two distinct machines
that are able to play samples, the <a href="Sampler.htm">sampler machine</a>, and <a href="Sampulse.htm">Sampulse</a>.<br />
Note: Soundfont samples (.sf2) are not supported. You can use the Fluidsynth native plugin, or 3rd party VST instruments for that.
</p>
<p>
The Psycle Sampler is an Internal Machine that is easy to setup and use.
It loads sampled sounds (.wav, .aiff, .iff/svx, .s3i and .its), defines automatically an instrument
to which some basic envelopes and loops can be added, and is played straight in the
pattern.<br />
It offers just a few pattern commands and it doesn't have any per-channel setup.<br />
</p>
<p>The Sampulse sampler is an advanced sampler, which incorporates most of the features and commands
of the classic trackers of the 90's, such as volume, pan, pitch and filter envelopes,
per-channel volume and panning, surround, and most of the commands like
volume slides, pitch slides, pan slides, retrig, arpeggio...<br />
It is a bit more difficult to configure, because instruments need to be told which wave sample they play,
(since it is possible that a single instrument uses more than one sample),
and adds support for .xi and .iti instrument format, plus Psycle's own one, .psins.
</p>
<p>
Notes are entered in the <a href="PatternEditor.htm">Pattern Editor</a> just like with 
other machines, but the auxiliary column is used to indicate the instrument to play.
These samples can also be edited in the Wave Editor (see below).
