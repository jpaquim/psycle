<p class="head2">Wave In Machine</p>
<p>The Wavein Machine is a very simple machine that acts as a door for audio from an external source. Basically, it will try to record whatever you have selected in your soundcard mixer as recording source (microphone, line in, cdrom... ) and send it to the effects you wire it to.<br>
This allows to use Psycle as a realtime effect machine (depending on how much latency your audio card adds).<br>
With ASIO, it only works with stereo sources, so trying to use the microphone input will result in no input sound.
