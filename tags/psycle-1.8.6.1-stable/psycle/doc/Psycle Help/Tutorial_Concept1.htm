OK, so you've just found Psycle, you've downloaded it, installed it and can't wait to start making music!  But where to begin?  When you start up Psycle, you have a blue screen with a rectange in the middle that says "Master".

<P class=head2>Psycle Concept No. 1</p>
Before you can enter any melodies, percussion or other notes, you have to set up Psycle to play or create your sounds.  Here is where the first of the two main concepts of Psycle come in:  Using Psycle is like using all those old hardware synths, which you would connect via cables to effects boxes, which would then be connected to your amplifier and then your speakers - the only difference here is that it's all virtual.
<P>
In Psycle, these virtual synths and effects are called <a href="Machine_Types.htm">machines</a>, which are broken into two types:  Generators and Effects.  Generators create the sounds, and effects modify them.  You will see them represented with boxes like the ones below (they can be changed by <a href="Config_Skins.htm">Skinning</a>).  The Master machine (the first one you see when you start up Psycle) is your virtual mixer. (Later on, you'll find that there is another <a href="Internal_Mixer.htm">mixer machine </a>)
<P> 
Most of the Psycle machines are plugins, which means you can add new ones besides those that come with Psycle.  There are three  categories:  Internal, Native and VSTs.  Internal machines are built into Psycle, Native plugins are designed specifically for psycle, and VST is a standard by Steinberg to create virtual synthesys (have a look at <a href="http://www.kvr-vst.com">www.kvr-vst.com</a> - there are many out there!).
<p class=head2>Making some noise</p>
<P>
So, now that you know what Psycle machines are, it's time to use them!  To add machines in your song, you need to open the "New machine" window by pressing F9 <b><i>OR</i></b> going to the menu item <i>View > Add New Machine <b>OR</i></b> double clicking the grey background.  If the list on the left-hand side of the window is not split up into "Generators" and "Effects", change the "Sort Machines" radiobutton to "By Class of Machine".
<P>
Click the "+" beside "Generators" item to expand the list.  Go down the list until you find "Arguru Synth 2 Final", select it and click OK.  You will now see that there is now another box on the blue area, which is the generator you just selected.  This generator can't produce any audible sound yet, because it's not connected to the Master machine.  To do this, right click over Arguru synth and drag from the generator to the Master machine.  You will see a line appears between the two, with a triangle pointing towards the Master Machine.  This indicates that sound will go from the generator to the Master Machine.

At last, time to make some noise!  If the generator isn't selected already (indicated by two little lines over each corner, or by the third combobox in the Psycle toolbar), click on a non-active part of it (i.e. where there's no buttons or sliders), and then press "Q-W-E-R-E-W-Q" (without the dashes).  Congratulations, you've made your first sounds with Psycle!
This demonstrates another feature of Psycle - playing notes from your computer keyboard.
