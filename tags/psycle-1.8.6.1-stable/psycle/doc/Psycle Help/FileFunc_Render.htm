The checkboxes provide a way to separate various elements of the track (either by each input to the master, the track or the machine), so that they can be mixed and mastered separately.</P>
<P><b>Note:</b> A few native plugins have problems with different sample rates e.g. the lfo in some of Pooplog's plugins behaves differently at different sample rates.  To avoid this, if possible, work in the same sample rate that you will render in.
