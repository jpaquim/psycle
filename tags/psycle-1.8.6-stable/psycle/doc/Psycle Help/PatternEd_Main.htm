<p class=head2>How the Pattern Editor Works</P>

The pattern editor is where you enter your music notes, percussion, and any other sounds you want to produce.  It consists of tracks, rows and columns.
<P>
A <b><i>pattern</i></b> is a small section of your song which is placed in sequence with other patterns, in the <a href="SequenceEditor.htm">Sequence Editor</a>.
<P>
A <b><i>track</i></b> is one of the major vertical subdivisions in the pattern window.  It is analogous to channels on a mixer - on each row in each track, only one note can play at a time (which is why there are multiple tracks).
<P><center>

The buttons R, S and M stand for <a href="PatternEd_Record.htm">record</a>, solo and mute, and apply to the track directly below.<P>
Entering music notes in Psycle is quite different from a music staff or piano roll (see the <a href="PatternEd_Notes.htm">Entering Notes</a> section).  If you are familiar with trackers you should have no problems at all, and even if you aren't, the interface isn't too hard to learn.  Commands to alter the parameters of machines (<a href="PatternEd_Tweak.htm">parameter automation</a>), are also entered in the Pattern Editor.
<P>
An important thing to note is that in the Pattern Editor, <b><i>hexadecimal</i></b> notation is used to specify numbers - instead of digits going <code>0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9</code>, they go <code>0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-A-B-C-D-E-F</code>.

<b>Note:</b> To enter any notes or other commands, the recording button (<img src="record.png" width="24" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle">) in the <a href="Bars_Toolbar.htm">Toolbar</a> must be enabled, otherwise patterns cannot be edited.
