Versions numbers have the following format (1.7.24 and later):</p>

<p><code>M.m.p</code></p>

<p> where:<br>

<b>M</b> = major version number.<br>

<b>m</b> = minor version number. If even, it's a stable
release, if odd, it's an unstable build or release candidate for next
stable minor version number.<br>

<b>p</b> = patch number. If the minor version number is
even (stable release), then this patch number is used for bug fixes,
so, it's hopefully rarely incremented. If the minor version number is
odd (unstable builds), then this patch number is incremented very
often, each CVS update.<br>

<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
allow the player to send commands to a machine from any pattern track
with a given channel (or "voice") number (bohan)<br>

If the machine is not a vst, and if the note is a "mcm" (hmm, poor name
if it's not related with midi), then, the fields in the event are
interpreted as <channel> <machine> <command> <parameter>.<br>

for example, 1122334444, means:<br>

11 is the channel (or "voice"),<br>

22 is the machine,<br>

33 is the command, and<br>

4444 is the parameter<br>

The player calls the Machine::Tick function with those values, and the
instrument value set to 0. The voice number 0xff is special and send
the same command to all voices.

<p class="head3">v1.7.x</p>

1.7.x were transitional versions, the changelog here keeps only the
internal/technical details,
and all the changes important from the point of view of the user are
moved or summarized above in the v1.8 log build and distribution
process:
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font>
fix closing bug [ 1087782 ] psycle MFC's version number is spread in
several places <br>

<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
added automatized compilation + packaging + update of psycle
sourceforge site for faster and more frequent updates (bohan) <br>

<font color="#0000ff"><b>*</b></font>
new versionning scheme, with three numbers <br>

<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>

options were used (multiline text) (bohan) <br>

<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
added cpu specific builds for 6th and 7th generation x86 CPUs (bohan)
internal changes in the source code: <br>

<font color="#0000ff"><b>*</b></font>
refactoring of the source code: cleaner internally, but no visible
changes for the users (bohan &amp; magnus) <br>

<font color="#0000ff"><b>*</b></font>
rewriting of the native and vst plugin hosts with exception handling
(bohan &amp; magnus) <br>

<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
let plugins find other .dll files that are in any intermediate dir
between their own dir and the configured root dir for plugins (bohan)
plugins which need helper .dll files (like druttis' sublime), can now
find it even if it's not placed in the same dir as psycle.exe ; it can
be placed along with the plugin (or actually, in any "intermediate"
dir). (bohan) note from bohan: i still think it would be better to
simply disallow having a deep directory tree of libraries and rather
put them all, flat, in the same dir. it would be a lot simpler, and
even have some technical advantages: what if a plugin depends on other
plugins for example? <br>

<font color="#0000ff"><b>*</b></font>
attempt to use boost::read_write_mutex instead of an exclusive mutex
for Song's lock. (bohan, doesn't work, dead locks) <br>

;p) and independent from the winapi (bohan) <br>

Fixed : Loading bug that causes volumes to be damaged between
native&lt;-&gt;VST&lt;-&gt;native connections.
Generally, you won't notice it, but the file is damaged (meaning, not

thing.
- twf Command removed. Now you can do the same with the twk command
(old songs will STILL show twf).<br>

- Removed code that makes a sampler machine change the polyphony to 8
when loading a song where it is 2. This was needed for old ( &gt;
1.1)songs.<br>

logic to update automatically these comboboxes when needed.

improves the visuals.
<br>

<font color="#0000ff"><b>*</b></font>
Changes in the MachineInterface.h definition file. (made by pooplog)
This causes all older machines to cease function.This concretely means
that M3, AS2.1 and Guru6 work no more (They were considered "Old/buggy"
machines anyway). Note: We have the sources of the M3 Buzz machine, so
soon we will have a Psycle version of it again.
<br>

<font color="#0000ff"><b>*</b></font>
New Machine Dialog (Plugin Browser) now supports up to 512 Plugins (256
was the limit before)
<br>

<font color="#0000ff"><b>*</b></font>
Changed the function which obtains the name of the VST plugins. You
should Refresh the machine list. (thanks to Destroy FX (
http://www.smartelectronix.com/~destroyfx ) for making us notice this)
Note: ZR-1 shows up as "flp" (which was the old name).
<br>

<font color="#0000ff"><b>*</b></font>
Modified also the way to get the Version Number. Most of the time you
will get "0" now. Don't know what is worse...

<font color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font>
Chords with VSTi's didn't work well if you did like : F-4 | A-4 | C-5
and in the next lines A-4 | C-5 | E-5 . It will STILL not work if you
do: F-4 | A-4 | C-5 and A-4 | off | off. Can't fix it completely
without recoding.
<br>

<br>

<font color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font>
Fixed ENORMOUS GUI bug in the pattern editor when you used FExx command
to change the TPB. Bugfix has consisted on changing the value only in

Psycle no more crashes when you accidentally make a loop with machines

indicate the MIDI channel, starting from 0 to F. Nothing means channel
0.
<br>

top) (Asked by sampler) <br>

<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>

the older Psycle versions. If it is deactivated, it acts like
ModPlug/IT, where cursor moves right in Gens/instr/Fx columns<br>

- Removed feature which made pattern go back to the starting one when
stopping playback and "follow song" was active. It used to cause
confusion. <br>

<font color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font>
Graphic bug: When selecting and moving the mouse out of the pattern (to
scroll), it showed a wrong selection (usually everything selected from
that track to left). This might have caused other graphical bugs, since
a variable was changed to an incorrect value. (Reported by Kris) <br>

Machine view and back. <br>

Added Graphics Double Buffering (No flicker). You should enable it in
the configuration Dialog. Note: This is just a temporary double buffer.

<br>

<font color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font>
Fixed (possible) Crash bug when specifying a machine number bigger than

Made changes in the "New Machine" dialog to show "Internal,Native,Vst"

don't respond properly in this mode (specifically delayed ones).

<font color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font>
Fixed Volume command (0Cxx) Now works also if there's no note.
IMPORTANT! Don't forget that in Psycle you need to indicate the
Generator Number also.
<br>

<font color="#0000ff"><b>*</b></font>
Loading and saving of block now use the internal clipboard. This means
you will have to copy the block before saving, and pasting the block
where you want after loading.
<br>

<font color="#0000ff"><b>*</b></font>
Edit Quantize = 0 Now moves the cursor to the next row in track (i.e.

<br>

<font color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font>
TPB and BPM are now updated when changed in pattern (FFxx and FExx
commands)
<p>Note: There's a serious memory leak (at least since 1.1b2) in
the loading/unloading function (most probably a bad destruction of
machines). Don't load many(5~10) songs per session or psycle will eat
your resources. This bug won't be fixed for 1.5betas, but maybe I'll
look at it in newer 1.x ones.
</p>

<p class="head3">v1.5b1+ (bugfix!)</p>

<br>

upwards) (well.. It was added in V1.5b1, but I forgot to add it in the
whatsnew)
<br>

<font color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font>
!!!!___Changed TPB command from FDxx to FExx___!!!! (Mistaken
internally)

the parameter part.
<br>

<font color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font>
Now trully fixed the lost of directory when loading (I fixed it when
saving, but for some reason I didn't for loading)<br>

Ps. Yes.. Commands for the Sampler will be in the next beta.<br>

Ps2. The key for the "twf" command is the same than the "twk", but
pressing Shift
<p class="head3">v1.5b1</p>

<br>

<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
"twf" command added and slightly changed the Generators Bar. This allow
tweaking effects in the same way you do with the twk command.
<br>

<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Note playback on Machine View! This allows to play notes while tweaking
the machines. _Known bug_: on VSTi's, notes are played only if you
don't select anything. This means that you can only play&amp;tweak
on Graphical VSTi's. (trick for long sounds : play the note and, just
after that, click on the machine title bar. weird but works)
<br>

<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Mouse support (Cursor positioning and block selecting) Mute still
avaiable clicking on the header of the tracks (clicking over the M or
the red light)
<br>

<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Track Soloing (Clicking over S or the green light). When Unsoloing, it
unmutes ALL tracks. If you find it problematic, I will add more code to
unmute only those that where muted when soloing that track.
<br>

<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Added Interpolation of command parameters. The Key is CTRL+I" (select a
block with the mouse then CTRL+I)
<br>

<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Tempo and TPB pattern commands added. They are FFxx and FExx
respectively Known bugs: They don't update the display and remain
changed after stopping. It will be fixed in next version.

".psy" extension is added automatically when saving.
<br>

<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>

<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Added &lt; &gt; to change the Generator. Right now it only
works on a spanish keyboard It will change in the future.. I hope you
can wait. If you have a block selected, then they will change it on the

<br>

<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Added the missing code to the "Dec" and "Clear" buttons in the
Sequencer.
<br>

<font color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font>
Patched (not fixed, but at least doesn't crash) the crash bug when
loading (in fact, when unloading) some psycle songs that use VST's.
Note: There are other (less frequent) crashes not related to this one
that are not fixed.

number wasn't divisible by the number of columns. (Example: Arguru Bass
HAD Volume parameter)
<br>

<font color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font>
Fixed (I hope) a loss of the current directory after loading or saving
songs.
<br>

<font color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font>
Changes in the "NewValue" Dialog (the one that lets you specify the
value of a machine parameter).<br>

-Title changed so that it is shown completely.<br>

-Editbox Changed, gets activated and text is selected when it's shown.
Also, allows adding the minus "-" sign. (also letters, but it ignores
them)<br>

-Also fixed: Cancel didn't cancelled (Values were changed)
<br>

<font color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font>
Fixed the Machine moving bug when the Machine frame got the focus after
some operations (example:clicking a machine, clicking the arrow of a
combobox and clicking over the machine view again)
<br>

<font color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font>
Instrument change with the arrows correctly changes the instrument in
the instrument dialog.
<br>

<font color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font>
TPB correctly updated when loading a song.
<br>

Note: This is a maintenance version. It's only aimed to make the usage
of the program easier and less buggy. Psycle 2 is being rebuilt from
the ground up to catch all the bugs (specially VST's related) and make
it even better.<br>

Note2:Yes, the interface is still quite slow...

the same way as native plug-ins, and all configuration is accessed by
double-clicking on the machine. One VST machine means one VST plugin
instance.
