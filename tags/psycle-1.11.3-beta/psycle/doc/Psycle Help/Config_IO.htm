<p class="head3">Audio I/O</p>
<p>
Depending on your system and soundcard, you will get several different
options for sound output. Options include Silent (no output), Windows waveout MME,
Directsound, ASIO (if supported) and WASAPI (If Vista or 7)</p>
By clicking the "Configure..." button, you can
set the device/soundcard to use, the sample rate and bit depth (depending on setting).
You can also set the buffer length, in total samples or in blocks of buffers depending on
driver. These will determine the latency (the delay in playback). If you
find your audio skips and breaks unnecessarily, you may need to increase
these values.
<p>Note: Most ASIO drivers, as well as WASAPI exclusive, will only allow sound
to be played by Psycle, dissallowing other applications to use the same soundcard
at the same time.</p>
<p>Psycle supports multithreaded audio since version 1.10. When specifying 0 audio threads, Psycle detects the number of processors/cores of your cpu and
uses that. Else, you can specify how many threads you want to use.
The selected value will be displayed in the <a href="Mon_CPU.htm">Cpu Monitor</a>
</p>

<p class="head3">MIDI I/O</p>
<p>Select the MIDI input device from the dropdown list. This will be the main device.
Sometimes there will be more than one port for your hardware, such as a MIDI through port and/or a data port.</p>
<p>If you are only using a MIDI keyboard or controller to send notes and tweaks to Psycle
while composing, you might find easier to use the Immediate Playback option. This doesn't
need a MIDI clock and there is no synchronization to the audio.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want to do so in realtime, using Psycle as a softsynth, it is
recommended that you setup a clock (which can be sent by the same MIDI device or another one),
and messages will get queued and played in synchronization with the audio.<br/>
This second method is covered in the  <a href="MIDI.htm">MIDI Tutorial</a></p>
<p>Both methods support receiving messages from multiple MIDI channels, route them to different
machines and remap the messages. The main difference is how they are processed by Psycle.</p>
