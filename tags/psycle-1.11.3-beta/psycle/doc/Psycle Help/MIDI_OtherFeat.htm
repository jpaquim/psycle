Can I use a sequencer instead of the internal Psycle tracker?
</p>
<p>
Yes, in sequenced mode, the MIDI input can replace the pattern in sending the data. This data is buffered and played relative to the timestamp that it belongs to.
</p>
<p class="head3">Can I mix using Psycle MIDI sounds and other synth/MIDI modules all controlled by my sequencer?
</p>
<p>
Yes. Psycle's MIDI support includes time syncronisation code. This allows fairly stable and usable syncronisation between Psycle generated audio and that generated by other synth/MIDI modules. You will need to set the latencies properly, or offset your non-Psycle MIDI/Audio tracks (in your sequencer) to align with the Psycle generator audio, but as long as you send some MIDI sync codes (or emulated sync) to Psycle you should keep the sync between the sequencer and Psycle. This is usually referred to as Transmit MIDI Start/Continue/Stop clock
</p>
<p>
Some sequencers (CakeWalk included) allow you to send a MIDI Sync Start code when playback is start from any point in the song (not just the very beginning). This is usually referred to as Use Start, never Continue or similar. If your sequencer has this facility it is recommed that you enable this in order to force Psycle to resync with the audio engine every time sequencer playback is initiated.

<p class="head3">
Can I mix using a sequencer with the internal tracker?
</p>
<p>
For the most part, the answer is No.<br/>
When the pattern view is active, MIDI input is always inmediate instead of synchronized. Also, there is no synchronization between the midi clock and the tracker position (nor does it listen to the BPM, if present)<br/>
Said that, MIDI does work while Psycle is playing, so it can be used for live playback to play notes and control parameters with a MIDI keyboard and or controller. 
</p>
<p class="head3">
Can I record MIDI triggered Psycle audio using the internal Psycle WAV recording facility?
</p>
<p>
Yes, it is possible using the record in realtime button in the toolbar. This button will start recording when pressed, and will stop when pressed again. It records all the audio that Psycle itself outputs.<br/>
Alternatively, there is also the possibility to use a virtual soundcard or use the feature to record what is playing if the soundcard supports it.
