<p>Versions are composed this way since 1.7.24, (except 1.8.5, which was a release):</p>
<p><code>M.m.p</code></p>
<p>where:<br />
<b>M</b> = major version number.<br />
<b>m</b> = minor version number. If even, it's a stable release, if odd,
it's an unstable build or release candidate for next stable minor
version number.<br />
<b>p</b> = patch number. If the minor version number is even (stable
release), then this patch number is used for bug fixes, so, it's
hopefully rarely incremented. If the minor version number is odd
(unstable builds), then this patch number is incremented very often,
each CVS update.<br />

<p>
<span class="addition">+</span> New default option to show note A4 in patterns as standard A4 (440Hz). Unchecking it keeps the old A5 = 440Hz.<br />

<span class="addition">+</span> Playback cursor position in wave editor.<br />
<span class="addition">+</span> Blue led on track header used to indicate track is playing. (Beware: It detects only if the machine produces audio, except for the sampler that is accurate).<br/>
<span class="change">*</span> Application is a bit more DPI aware now. (Just behaving a bit better at 125% increase. It probably will never be fully DPI aware).<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Scrolling in pattern view made slower.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Vumeter in main view made RMS. Stereo vu in Master window.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Dropped option of graphics double buffering. Now always enabled.<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> Rewiring of mixer sends/returns would not work sometimes.<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> Prevent crash on savewav dialog if path does not exist<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> RC1 bugfixes (recent menu was not keeping the correct entries. Feature of saving pattern track names was not reading them back, Mixer can be muted and bypassed again, Render wav added looped audio at the end, undo in pattern crashing Psycle, MIDI driver not getting selected, problem loading skins).<br />
</p>
<p class="head3">v1.8.8 RC1</p>
<p>
<span class="addition">+</span> Pattern tracks can be named now. Find the new settings on the pattern properties dialog.<br />
<span class="addition">+</span> New Machine and pattern skin and default colours thanks to Angelus.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Reimplemented most of the Settings system (This includes many things, from making all them accessible from a central point in the code, an user option to save them to other places than the windows registry, real-time change of audio driver, centralized the code to import/export the visual and keyboard settings, and more)<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Toolbar improvements (now they are all detachable, new graphics, some UI reordering, context menu on the sequence list). Also, separated the toolbar sourcecode into independent files.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Fonts use now default quality (which means allowing antialias if setting activated on Windows).<br />
<span class="change">*</span> WireDlg, and machine parameter window can now be closed with ESC key (Only XMSampler window cannot be closed this way now).<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Internal source code change: Implemented the sliders with OnHScroll/VScroll message handler (proper way of doing it) on XMSamplerMixerPage, WireDlg, Master Dialog, master slider on the toolbar and in Wave Recording machine dialog. Other improvements on the open/closing of those dialogs.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Changes on the Machine parameter windows, merged several sources. Now Native windows offer the same menu/toolbar features than VST ones.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> There are two presets files now, one in the same directory as the plugin, and a new one on the presets directory. This second one is called "User presets" in the banks menu and is editable from the presets dialog.<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> beta 3 bugfixes (wasapi not restoring setting, wasapi problems in Vista, deadlock due to SetSampleRate, WireDlg malfunctioning, stk reverbs and stk shakers crashing/malfunctioning, jbridge integration now works )<br />
</p>
<p class="head3">v1.8.8 beta 3</p>
<p>
<span class="addition">+</span> Added ability to send midi commands to native machines. Yannis Midi and fluidsynth now support it.<br />
<span class="addition">+</span> Finished WASAPI audio driver for Windows Vista and 7. Supports both, shared and exclusive mode.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Improvements on MME waveout and Directsound. Both support up to 32bits float now (if supported by driver/OS).<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Improvements on fluidsynth and yannis midi usage. Now aux column is always filled, and the aux combobox filled properly.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Improvements on fluidsynth. If it doesn't find the soundfont on loading, it asks for the placement.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Improvements on the whole MIDI input. In keyboard mode it is possible to play a midi file sending midi commands to psycle and using one fluidsynth.<br />
Find the new options in the Midi Input page to select generator and instrument. Also the MIDI Monitor is useful now with Keyboard mode.<br />
In Sequenced mode, improved the synchronization code and now works with all the audio drivers (note: you need to send a clock start).<br />
<span class="change">*</span> New option in the CPU Monitor to *not* measure the individual CPU usage. When using many machines, the effect is big.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Some more improvements  in multithreading. Now, song load/save/new don't stop and restart the audio driver.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> "Skinned" mode for the UI controls, without the need of the manifest file (no more windows 98 look&amp;feel). Several small style changes on the UI.<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> Fixes in wave input. Now it works with all drivers, supports multiple wave in machines and correctly selects the input port. (Note: changing audio driver with a wavein machine loaded is still not 100% safe, but it shouldn't crash).<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> Fixes in audio sample rate change, audio output selection change and midi input selection change.<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> beta 2 bugfixes<br />

</p>

<p>
<span class="addition">+</span> Added range to the Interpolate curve dialog, and autodetect range if tweak or command found in selection.<br />
<span class="addition">+</span> In Vista and 7, there's a preliminary WASAPI exclusive mode driver replacing the MME driver. Configuration will come for final release.<br />

<span class="change">*</span> Fixed the mixer in single threaded mode.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> All effects should now be samplerate aware. Improved some of their visuals. Fixed bugs in some of them (like haas). (Audacity compressor may still change)<br />
<span class="change">*</span> A greatly improved legasynth tb303, and upgraded fluidsynth sf2 to version 1.1.2. The rest of generators will get revised before final release.<br />

<span class="change">*</span> Migrated to Visual Studio 2008 (and its runtimes) and boost 1.41.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Better Vista/7 support (placement of files).<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> Multiple fixes in the native plugins (better support of other sampling rates than 44Khz). Better UIs in some of them. (Not all native plugins revised yet).<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> Small fixes.<br />
</p>

<p class="head3">v1.7.x</p>
1.7.x were transitional versions, the changelog here keeps only the
internal/technical details, and all the changes important from the point
of view of the user are moved or summarized above in the v1.8 log build
and distribution process:
<p><span class="bugfix">!</span> fix closing bug [ 1087782 ]
psycle MFC's version number is spread in several places <br />
<span class="addition">+</span> added automatized compilation +
packaging + update of psycle sourceforge site for faster and more
frequent updates (bohan) <br />
<span class="change">*</span> new versionning scheme, with three
numbers <br />

<span class="addition">+</span> added cpu specific builds for 6th

<br />
<span class="change">*</span> refactoring of the source code:
cleaner internally, but no visible changes for the users (bohan &amp;
magnus) <br />
<span class="change">*</span> rewriting of the native and vst
plugin hosts with exception handling (bohan &amp; magnus) <br />

<span class="addition">+</span> let plugins find other .dll files
that are in any intermediate dir between their own dir and the
configured root dir for plugins (bohan) plugins which need helper .dll
files (like druttis' sublime), can now find it even if it's not placed
in the same dir as psycle.exe ; it can be placed along with the plugin
(or actually, in any "intermediate" dir). (bohan) note from bohan: i
still think it would be better to simply disallow having a deep
directory tree of libraries and rather put them all, flat, in the same
dir. it would be a lot simpler, and even have some technical advantages:
what if a plugin depends on other plugins for example? <br />
<span class="change">*</span> attempt to use
boost::read_write_mutex instead of an exclusive mutex for Song's lock.

<p class="head3">v1.66</p>
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Added elapsed playtime (by KooPer)
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Now loading songs with machines outside of the screen moves them to a
visible area.
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
VST host correctly does "idle" calls to VST's now. This supposedly makes
AbSynth work.
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
VST host now replies to "GetParameterQuantization". Some plugins use
this to round correctly.
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Added Patch to make VSTi sc-101 from SC developers work. (Not an awesome
plugin anyway, and crashes)
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
New machine graphics thanks to /\/\ark.
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Added four colour themes selectable via a comboox in
configuration-settings, "visual" folder.
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Important change in the Song Loading routine to load better the VST
Plugins. Also, now saves the program number, so VST's like "Triangle
II", "Vivaldi" and "Ganymed" work! New Files wont load VST's in previous
versions of Psycle. It's sort of a security for newer files.
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Changed the sequencer a bit: Now only shows the patterns within the
sequence length. (Following a request made some time ago) Added "add 10"
and "dec 10" to pattern position (This will make some happy too) Now
Insert inserts after the current position (previously, it was before).
"Next Pattern" keyboard key now auto inserts new pattern when reaching
the end. Removed "setLen", since now it is a bit useless. Removed
"Spread" and replaced by "Sort patterns".
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Changed Wav loading routines to use RIFF loader. This allows to see
SoundForge's loops settings.
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Pattern editor now hides the "0000" value in effects column (when it is
not used as twk or mcm)
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Cleaned up a bit the Instrument editor Dialog (No new functionality yet)
and fixed little errors in the envelopes editor.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed several problems with VST's and presets. (pooplog made changes to
allow his plugins to save extra data, but he didn't realize that VST's
do save in .prs format too)
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed that annoying "param increased by 1" bug with some VST's. (
int(intvar-b) != intvar-(int)b )

<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed Native machines window now correctly shown in windows
XP/nonstandard-titlebar-sizes.
<br />

combobox.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed a cause for crash when loading songs/closing Psycle. (paint
updating while deleting song)
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed : Flanger Machine could become unstable and use all the CPU
avaiable when the feedback was higher than 50% and the input sound
stopped.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed : Loading bug that causes volumes to be damaged between
native&lt;-&gt;VST&lt;-&gt;native connections. Generally, you won't
notice it, but the file is damaged (meaning, not complying to what there
should be in the file). The saving routine has been fixed and the loader
routine has been modified to be aware of this problem.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed : Loading a sample with a name longer than 32chars, activated the
"Tempo Syncronized Loop"
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed : Rare "divide by zero" error at startup fixed ( thanks to Gulrak
for this )
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>

command (old songs will STILL show twf).
<br />
- Removed code that makes a sampler machine change the polyphony to 8
when loading a song where it is 2. This was needed for old ( &gt;
1.1)songs.
<br />
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
GUI Improved: Little placement changes, new combobox and a new internal
logic to update automatically these comboboxes when needed.
<br />

<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Little changes in the Native Machine interface made by pooplog. This
improves the visuals.
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Changes in the MachineInterface.h definition file. (made by pooplog)
This causes all older machines to cease function.This concretely means
that M3, AS2.1 and Guru6 work no more (They were considered "Old/buggy"
machines anyway). Note: We have the sources of the M3 Buzz machine, so
soon we will have a Psycle version of it again.
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
New Machine Dialog (Plugin Browser) now supports up to 512 Plugins (256
was the limit before)
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Changed the function which obtains the name of the VST plugins. You

Note: ZR-1 shows up as "flp" (which was the old name).
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Modified also the way to get the Version Number. Most of the time you
will get "0" now. Don't know what is worse...
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>

started by MIDI commands if the plugin doesn't support "all notes off"
event)
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Chords with VSTi's didn't work well if you did like : F-4 | A-4 | C-5
and in the next lines A-4 | C-5 | E-5 . It will STILL not work if you
do: F-4 | A-4 | C-5 and A-4 | off | off. Can't fix it completely without
recoding.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed bug: Entering "twk" or "twf" command in the pattern was
innecessary executed. This could have caused many parameters to get

so) <br />

Scrollbars being incorrectly activated/deactivated. <br />
<span class="change">*</span> Space bar now doesn't stop the

VSTi's. Use the AUX/Inst colum to indicate the MIDI channel, starting
from 0 to F. Nothing means channel 0. <br />

top) (Asked by sampler)
<br />

ModPlug/IT, where cursor moves right in Gens/instr/Fx columns

stopping playback and "follow song" was active. It used to cause
confusion.

<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Graphic bug where scrolling up/down made the cursor move (This was
entered as a side effect of a new feature)
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Graphic bug: When selecting and moving the mouse out of the pattern (to
scroll), it showed a wrong selection (usually everything selected from
that track to left). This might have caused other graphical bugs, since

Machine view and back.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>

http://www.smartelectronix.com/musicdsp for FAST sine calculation
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed (possible) Crash bug when specifying a machine number bigger than

wavs (Reported by Kris)

<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Master Machine now uses around 25% less CPU time. (Removed non important

now uses a lot less RAM! <br />

IMPORTANT! Don't forget that in Psycle you need to indicate the
Generator Number also.

you will have to copy the block before saving, and pasting the block
where you want after loading.

Machine Panning was not properly initialized when loading a song. Fixed.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
TPB and BPM are now updated when changed in pattern (FFxx and FExx
commands)
<p>Note: There's a serious memory leak (at least since 1.1b2) in the
loading/unloading function (most probably a bad destruction of
machines). Don't load many(5~10) songs per session or psycle will eat
your resources. This bug won't be fixed for 1.5betas, but maybe I'll
look at it in newer 1.x ones.</p>
<p class="head3">v1.5b1+ (bugfix!)</p>

Interpolation now iterpolates the full command/parameter row, not only
the parameter part.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Now trully fixed the lost of directory when loading (I fixed it when
saving, but for some reason I didn't for loading)
<br />
Ps. Yes.. Commands for the Sampler will be in the next beta.
<br />
Ps2. The key for the "twf" command is the same than the "twk", but
pressing Shift
<p class="head3">v1.5b1</p>

tweaking effects in the same way you do with the twk command.
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Note playback on Machine View! This allows to play notes while tweaking
the machines. _Known bug_: on VSTi's, notes are played only if you don't
select anything. This means that you can only play&amp;tweak on
Graphical VSTi's. (trick for long sounds : play the note and, just after
that, click on the machine title bar. weird but works)
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Mouse support (Cursor positioning and block selecting) Mute still
avaiable clicking on the header of the tracks (clicking over the M or
the red light)
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Track Soloing (Clicking over S or the green light). When Unsoloing, it
unmutes ALL tracks. If you find it problematic, I will add more code to
unmute only those that where muted when soloing that track.
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Added Interpolation of command parameters. The Key is CTRL+I" (select a
block with the mouse then CTRL+I)
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Tempo and TPB pattern commands added. They are FFxx and FExx
respectively Known bugs: They don't update the display and remain
changed after stopping. It will be fixed in next version.
<br />

".psy" extension is added automatically when saving.
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>

Popup menu will be added in next version)
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Added &lt; &gt; to change the Generator. Right now it only works on a

you have a block selected, then they will change it on the Block.
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Added the missing code to the "Dec" and "Clear" buttons in the
Sequencer.
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>

<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Crash when showing the properties dialog (the one showed when right
clicking) of machines with a name longer than 15 chars (ex: VB-1 Virtual
Instrument)
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Patched (not fixed, but at least doesn't crash) the crash bug when
loading (in fact, when unloading) some psycle songs that use VST's.
Note: There are other (less frequent) crashes not related to this one
that are not fixed.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed strange crash with some old songs (1.1b1?) that had a wrong TPB
(thanks bunny)
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed bug where Parameters of machines weren't shown if the total number
wasn't divisible by the number of columns. (Example: Arguru Bass HAD
Volume parameter)
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed (I hope) a loss of the current directory after loading or saving
songs.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Changes in the "NewValue" Dialog (the one that lets you specify the
value of a machine parameter).
<br />
-Title changed so that it is shown completely.
<br />
-Editbox Changed, gets activated and text is selected when it's shown.
Also, allows adding the minus "-" sign. (also letters, but it ignores
them)
<br />
-Also fixed: Cancel didn't cancelled (Values were changed)
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed the Machine moving bug when the Machine frame got the focus after
some operations (example:clicking a machine, clicking the arrow of a
combobox and clicking over the machine view again)
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Instrument change with the arrows correctly changes the instrument in
the instrument dialog.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
TPB correctly updated when loading a song.
<br />
Note: This is a maintenance version. It's only aimed to make the usage
of the program easier and less buggy. Psycle 2 is being rebuilt from the
ground up to catch all the bugs (specially VST's related) and make it
even better.
<br />
Note2:Yes, the interface is still quite slow...
<p class="head3">v1.1b2</p>
<span class="change">*</span>
Reimplemented WAV recording (it automatically stops when song loops and
doesn't start until 'play' is clicked)
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Changed the VST interface slightly - some machines still crash when
selecting the common GUI, although e.g. the Model-E works now.
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Fixed a CPU cost calculation bug
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>

<br />
<span class="change">*</span>

<br />
<span class="change">*</span>

minutes:seconds
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Fixed sampler note off bug - now a note off command only affects voices
assigned to that track
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Fixed New Machine refresh bug
<p class="head3">v1.1b1</p>
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Machine muting now works, a muted machine is indicated by the red light
being lit
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Loads and saves the 1.0x file format, although I had to bend over
backwards to support this! The file format WILL change...
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Ticks Per Beat implemented - even compatible with the old file format :)
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Added "Refresh" button to New Machine dialog - now you can add plugins
without restarting :)
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Sampler polyphony is now per-machine rather than per-track. When a track
is loaded and the polyphony is less than 4, it is automatically set to
8.
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
INSERT moves pattern data down and CTRL+DELETE move patterndata up
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
VST dialogs &amp; host totally redesigned - you now create VST plug-ins
the same way as native plug-ins, and all configuration is accessed by
double-clicking on the machine. One VST machine means one VST plugin
instance.
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Changed configuration dialog to include default directories for Songs,
