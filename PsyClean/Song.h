// Song class
// The Song class shall store:
// - Patterns
// - Sequences
// 



// [JAZ]: the next step is defining the Song Class, and each one of its members's classes
// Guillaume: ok, I make it my current task
// [JAZ]: good. Don't worry if you do it right or not. you can check psycle's sourcecode for guideline, but I advise you that it is not very object oriented.
// [JAZ]: Patterns should be defined as one, sequence surely too (since a sequence is no longer an array of numbers)
