This directory contains configuration files for the buildbot software, an continuous integration tool.

You can consult the buildbot master instance running for the psycle project at
http://buildborg.retropaganda.info:8010

Build failures are also notified on the #psycle IRC channel on EFnet,
and are also sent by mail to the sourceforge users to blame (only works if you unblocked mail on your profile settings).

If you wish to contribute your own slave buildbot instance to this project (e.g. for windows builds, that we currently don't have),
please send a mail to johan-boule@users.sourceforge.net so that i can attach it to the project's master instance.
