* #include scanner for msvc: cl.exe -showincludes ... http://www.conifersystems.com/2008/10/09/dependencies-from-showincludes/

* --help shouldn't create the build dir.

* need a way to select a script from the command line instead of just a source dir (via --src-dir).

* integrate binreloc.

* versionned libs; also take care of relinking clients of shared libs when their version changed.

* rewrite colorgcc in python; low priority, since clang already has colors natively.

* experiment with beta-mode like tup.

* speedup boost lib detection : try multiple link names in parellel and don't #include

* when linking fails, remove symlinks

* @task decorator : allow tasks directly on functions
