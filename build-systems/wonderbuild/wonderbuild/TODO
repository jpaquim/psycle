* --help shouldn't create the build dir.

* need a way to select a script from the command line instead of just a source dir (via --src-dir).

* cannot test tty on jython (should look at the underlying platform hidden behind the jvm).

* integrate binreloc.

* generate .pc files.

* the caller of a script-loader-task should be able to choose wether to collect their default tasks.

* c lang support.

* versionned libs. (also take care of relinking clients of shared libs when their version changed)

* the path to colorgcc shouldn't be signed, but rather the path to the real compiler.
  this stupidly triggers rebuild when changing from non-tty to tty or vice versa.

* rewrite colorgcc in python.

* standard flags flavors for debug, release, and strip.
  (not sure this is very useful)
  
* experiment with beta-mode like tup.
