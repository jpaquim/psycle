 Wonderbuild - the fastest programmable build tool
===================================================

Wonderbuild is a build tool that handles all the phases
involved in building softwares: configuration/checks, build, installation.

Builds are described in python modules.
Wonderbuild does not try to hide the python language, it requires
to have a good knowledge of python. On the other hand, if you do know
python well enough, it shouldn't take a long time to learn wonderbuild
since it exposes only a minimal number of powerful concepts,
rather than burying everything behind a massive API.

If you don't like waiting a long time for your builds to finish,
you'll be pleased with the speed wonderbuild reaches: it has been
designed from the ground up to be the fastest build tool, and according
to benchmarks done with it and various other build tools,
the goal has been reached, You can read some benchmarks here:
http://psycle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/psycle/branches/bohan/wonderbuild/benchmarks/time.xml

Wonderbuild's speed is due to an implementation that:
- allows tasks to start executing immediately,
	discovering task dependencies dynamically,
- makes it possible to take advantage of multi-cpu/core systems at all levels in the code,
	never loosing an opportunity of parallelism,
- minimises filesystem calls.

Wonderbuild is currently undocumented. The closest tool in concept is fbuild,
so i suggest you read fbuild's documentation to get some ideas.
