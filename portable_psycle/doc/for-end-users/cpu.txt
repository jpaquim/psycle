The pack contains the "doc" dir,
and directories containing the binaries themselves,
of the psycle host application, and all the open source native plugins.

All binaries come currently in two versions, one for each CPU type. Both are included in the pack:

	- "recent" AMD and Intel CPUs:
		- G7: AMD Athlon and early Duron.
		- G7-SSE:
			AMD: Athlon XP, late Duron, Athlon 64, Athlon FX,
			Intel: Pentium 4, Celeron Pentium 4, Pentium M Centrino

	- "old" Intel CPUs:
		- G6: Intel Pentium Pro, Pentium II, and early Celeron.
		- G6-SSE: Intel Pentium III and Celeron Pentium III.

Currently, we don't distribute builds for older CPUs, G5: Intel Pentium I, AMD K6, K6-2, K6-III, 5x86, 6x86, etc.
If you request us to add it, we'll add it.

At the time of this writing, AMD Athlon 64/FX and Intel IA-64 are not yet widely used,
and we don't have tools to make builds for these CPUs.
