HACKING ON QPSYCLE
------------------

These are some guidelines to bear in mind when coding
in qpsycle.



include files
-------------

In the GUI files, include psycore files first, followed by
other GUI files, followed by standard library includes,
followed by Qt includes.

For example:

#include "psycore/song.h"

#include "machineview/machineview.h"

#include <map>

#include <QLabel>

psycore has to go before Qt due to a conflict between
boost::signals and Qt.


Adding yourself as an author
----------------------------

If you add some code to qpsycle, please add your name to
the AUTHORS file with a note of what you added.  Don't
put your name in the actual code file.
