Brief DirectX driver help

The DirectX driver can be used in two modes; exclusive and non-exclusive.
These are selected by checking and unchecking the "exclusive" box.
In exclusive mode, the driver assumes exclusive control of the
primary Direct Sound buffer. This means that Direct Sound's internal
mixing routines are bypassed, and that some overhead is lost, thus
resulting in lower latency. It also means that no other application
can use any sound until Psycle is terminated, another driver is
selected, or the "exclusive" box is unchecked.

I had some problems on my computer with high-frequency noise when
using the non-exclusive mode (probably because of Direct Sound's
internal mixer), so always try the exclusive mode if you
encounter similar problems.

Oh, and you'll need at least DirectX 7.
