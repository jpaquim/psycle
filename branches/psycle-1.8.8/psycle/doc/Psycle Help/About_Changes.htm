<p>Versions are composed this way since 1.7.24, (except 1.8.5, which was a release):</p>
<p><code>M.m.p</code></p>
<p>where:<br />
<b>M</b> = major version number.<br />
<b>m</b> = minor version number. If even, it's a stable release, if odd,
it's an unstable build or release candidate for next stable minor
version number.<br />
<b>p</b> = patch number. If the minor version number is even (stable
release), then this patch number is used for bug fixes, so, it's
hopefully rarely incremented. If the minor version number is odd
(unstable builds), then this patch number is incremented very often,
each CVS update.<br />
</p>
<p>Legend : <br />
<span class="addition">+</span> = addition <br />
<span class="change">*</span> = change <br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> = bugfix</p>
<br />
<p class="head3">v1.10.0 (1.8.8 was renamed 1.10 before release)</p>
<p>
<span class="addition">+</span> New default option to show note A4 in patterns as standard A4 (440Hz). Unchecking it keeps the old A5 = 440Hz.<br />
<span class="addition">+</span> add a new track on cursor position for the current pattern or all patterns.<br />
<span class="addition">+</span> add a machine before or after another machine. Also option to add a machine in the middle of an existing wire.<br />
<span class="addition">+</span> deleting an effect with connected wires can keep neighbours connected now.<br />
<span class="addition">+</span> Playback cursor position in wave editor.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Application is a bit more DPI aware now. (Just behaving a bit better at 125% increase. It probably will never be fully DPI aware).<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Scrolling in pattern view made slower.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Vumeter in main view made RMS. Stereo vu in Master window.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Dropped option of graphics double buffering. Now always enabled.<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> Rewiring of mixer sends/returns would not work sometimes.<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> Prevent crash on savewav dialog if path does not exist<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> RC1 bugfixes (recent menu was not keeping the correct entries. Feature of saving pattern track names was not reading them back, Mixer can be muted and bypassed again, Render wav added looped audio at the end, undo in pattern crashing Psycle, MIDI driver not getting selected, problem loading skins).<br />
</p>
<p class="head3">v1.8.8 RC1</p>
<p>
<span class="addition">+</span> Pattern tracks can be named now. Find the new settings on the pattern properties dialog.<br />
<span class="addition">+</span> New Machine and pattern skin and default colours thanks to Angelus.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Reimplemented most of the Settings system (This includes many things, from making all them accessible from a central point in the code, an user option to save them to other places than the windows registry, real-time change of audio driver, centralized the code to import/export the visual and keyboard settings, and more)<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Toolbar improvements (now they are all detachable, new graphics, some UI reordering, context menu on the sequence list). Also, separated the toolbar sourcecode into independent files.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Fonts use now default quality (which means allowing antialias if setting activated on Windows).<br />
<span class="change">*</span> WireDlg, and machine parameter window can now be closed with ESC key (Only XMSampler window cannot be closed this way now).<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Internal source code change: Implemented the sliders with OnHScroll/VScroll message handler (proper way of doing it) on XMSamplerMixerPage, WireDlg, Master Dialog, master slider on the toolbar and in Wave Recording machine dialog. Other improvements on the open/closing of those dialogs.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Changes on the Machine parameter windows, merged several sources. Now Native windows offer the same menu/toolbar features than VST ones.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> There are two presets files now, one in the same directory as the plugin, and a new one on the presets directory. This second one is called "User presets" in the banks menu and is editable from the presets dialog.<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> beta 3 bugfixes (wasapi not restoring setting, wasapi problems in Vista, deadlock due to SetSampleRate, WireDlg malfunctioning, stk reverbs and stk shakers crashing/malfunctioning, jbridge integration now works )<br />
</p>
<p class="head3">v1.8.8 beta 3</p>
<p>
<span class="addition">+</span> Added ability to send midi commands to native machines. Yannis Midi and fluidsynth now support it.<br />
<span class="addition">+</span> Finished WASAPI audio driver for Windows Vista and 7. Supports both, shared and exclusive mode.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Improvements on MME waveout and Directsound. Both support up to 32bits float now (if supported by driver/OS).<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Improvements on fluidsynth and yannis midi usage. Now aux column is always filled, and the aux combobox filled properly.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Improvements on fluidsynth. If it doesn't find the soundfont on loading, it asks for the placement.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Improvements on the whole MIDI input. In keyboard mode it is possible to play a midi file sending midi commands to psycle and using one fluidsynth.<br />
Find the new options in the Midi Input page to select generator and instrument. Also the MIDI Monitor is useful now with Keyboard mode.<br />
In Sequenced mode, improved the synchronization code and now works with all the audio drivers (note: you need to send a clock start).<br />
<span class="change">*</span> New option in the CPU Monitor to *not* measure the individual CPU usage. When using many machines, the effect is big.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Some more improvements  in multithreading. Now, song load/save/new don't stop and restart the audio driver.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> "Skinned" mode for the UI controls, without the need of the manifest file (no more windows 98 look&amp;feel). Several small style changes on the UI.<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> Fixes in wave input. Now it works with all drivers, supports multiple wave in machines and correctly selects the input port. (Note: changing audio driver with a wavein machine loaded is still not 100% safe, but it shouldn't crash).<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> Fixes in audio sample rate change, audio output selection change and midi input selection change.<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> beta 2 bugfixes<br />

</p>

<p>
<span class="addition">+</span> Added range to the Interpolate curve dialog, and autodetect range if tweak or command found in selection.<br />
<span class="addition">+</span> In Vista and 7, there's a preliminary WASAPI exclusive mode driver replacing the MME driver. Configuration will come for final release.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Fixed installers. Now one for x32 and one for x64. Fixed also the downloading of files from internet.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Fixed the mixer in single threaded mode.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> All effects should now be samplerate aware. Improved some of their visuals. Fixed bugs in some of them (like haas). (Audacity compressor may still change)<br />
<span class="change">*</span> A greatly improved legasynth tb303, and upgraded fluidsynth sf2 to version 1.1.2. The rest of generators will get revised before final release.<br />
</p>

<p class="head3">v1.8.8 beta 1</p>

<span class="change">*</span> Migrated to Visual Studio 2008 (and its runtimes) and boost 1.41.<br />
<span class="change">*</span> Better Vista/7 support (placement of files).<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> Multiple fixes in the native plugins (better support of other sampling rates than 44Khz). Better UIs in some of them. (Not all native plugins revised yet).<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> Small fixes.<br />
</p>

11 is the channel (or "voice"),<br />
22 is the machine,<br />

4444 is the parameter<br />

instrument value set to 0. The voice number 0xff is special and send the
same command to all voices. <br />

<p class="head3">v1.7.x</p>
1.7.x were transitional versions, the changelog here keeps only the
internal/technical details, and all the changes important from the point
of view of the user are moved or summarized above in the v1.8 log build
and distribution process:
<p><span class="bugfix">!</span> fix closing bug [ 1087782 ]
psycle MFC's version number is spread in several places <br />
<span class="addition">+</span> added automatized compilation +
packaging + update of psycle sourceforge site for faster and more
frequent updates (bohan) <br />
<span class="change">*</span> new versionning scheme, with three
numbers <br />
<span class="addition">+</span> The version info and the about box
is modified to show what build options were used (multiline text)
(bohan) <br />
<span class="addition">+</span> added cpu specific builds for 6th
and 7th generation x86 CPUs (bohan) internal changes in the source code:
<br />
<span class="change">*</span> refactoring of the source code:
cleaner internally, but no visible changes for the users (bohan &amp;
magnus) <br />
<span class="change">*</span> rewriting of the native and vst
plugin hosts with exception handling (bohan &amp; magnus) <br />
<span class="change">*</span> ported the open source native
plugins to the new compiler (bohan) <br />
<span class="addition">+</span> let plugins find other .dll files
that are in any intermediate dir between their own dir and the
configured root dir for plugins (bohan) plugins which need helper .dll
files (like druttis' sublime), can now find it even if it's not placed
in the same dir as psycle.exe ; it can be placed along with the plugin
(or actually, in any "intermediate" dir). (bohan) note from bohan: i
still think it would be better to simply disallow having a deep
directory tree of libraries and rather put them all, flat, in the same
dir. it would be a lot simpler, and even have some technical advantages:
what if a plugin depends on other plugins for example? <br />
<span class="change">*</span> attempt to use
boost::read_write_mutex instead of an exclusive mutex for Song's lock.
(bohan, doesn't work, dead locks) <br />
<span class="addition">+</span> added optional (masked otherwize)
handling of fpu exceptions (bohan) <br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span> rearranged the midi code ; closing
sourceforge bug #1087788 (bohan) <br />
<span class="change">*</span> interface of the registry class
more "c++ oriented" (if that term exist ;p) and independent from the
winapi (bohan) <br />
<span class="change">*</span> Importing configuration from older
psycle's and psycle alpha (jaz) <br />

improves the visuals.
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>
Changes in the MachineInterface.h definition file. (made by pooplog)
This causes all older machines to cease function.This concretely means
that M3, AS2.1 and Guru6 work no more (They were considered "Old/buggy"
machines anyway). Note: We have the sources of the M3 Buzz machine, so
soon we will have a Psycle version of it again.

now uses a lot less RAM! <br />
<span class="change">*</span> Arguru Synth 2f comes to replace

Removed NoteOff in x frames (yyCx) I think nobody knew it anyway.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed Volume command (0Cxx) Now works also if there's no note.
IMPORTANT! Don't forget that in Psycle you need to indicate the
Generator Number also.
<br />
<span class="change">*</span>

you will have to copy the block before saving, and pasting the block
where you want after loading.

Machine Panning was not properly initialized when loading a song. Fixed.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
TPB and BPM are now updated when changed in pattern (FFxx and FExx
commands)
<p>Note: There's a serious memory leak (at least since 1.1b2) in the
loading/unloading function (most probably a bad destruction of
machines). Don't load many(5~10) songs per session or psycle will eat
your resources. This bug won't be fixed for 1.5betas, but maybe I'll
look at it in newer 1.x ones.</p>
<p class="head3">v1.5b1+ (bugfix!)</p>
<br />

Interpolation now iterpolates the full command/parameter row, not only

<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Now trully fixed the lost of directory when loading (I fixed it when
saving, but for some reason I didn't for loading)
<br />
Ps. Yes.. Commands for the Sampler will be in the next beta.
<br />
Ps2. The key for the "twf" command is the same than the "twk", but
pressing Shift

tweaking effects in the same way you do with the twk command.
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Note playback on Machine View! This allows to play notes while tweaking
the machines. _Known bug_: on VSTi's, notes are played only if you don't
select anything. This means that you can only play&amp;tweak on
Graphical VSTi's. (trick for long sounds : play the note and, just after
that, click on the machine title bar. weird but works)
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Mouse support (Cursor positioning and block selecting) Mute still
avaiable clicking on the header of the tracks (clicking over the M or
the red light)
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>

unmutes ALL tracks. If you find it problematic, I will add more code to
unmute only those that where muted when soloing that track.
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Added Interpolation of command parameters. The Key is CTRL+I" (select a
block with the mouse then CTRL+I)
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Tempo and TPB pattern commands added. They are FFxx and FExx
respectively Known bugs: They don't update the display and remain
changed after stopping. It will be fixed in next version.

".psy" extension is added automatically when saving.
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>

Popup menu will be added in next version)
<br />
<font color="#078d1b"><b>+</b></font>
Added &lt; &gt; to change the Generator. Right now it only works on a

Added the missing code to the "Dec" and "Clear" buttons in the
Sequencer.

Instrument)
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Patched (not fixed, but at least doesn't crash) the crash bug when
loading (in fact, when unloading) some psycle songs that use VST's.
Note: There are other (less frequent) crashes not related to this one
that are not fixed.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed strange crash with some old songs (1.1b1?) that had a wrong TPB
(thanks bunny)
<br />

Fixed bug where Parameters of machines weren't shown if the total number
wasn't divisible by the number of columns. (Example: Arguru Bass HAD
Volume parameter)
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed (I hope) a loss of the current directory after loading or saving
songs.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Changes in the "NewValue" Dialog (the one that lets you specify the
value of a machine parameter).
<br />
-Title changed so that it is shown completely.
<br />
-Editbox Changed, gets activated and text is selected when it's shown.
Also, allows adding the minus "-" sign. (also letters, but it ignores
them)
<br />
-Also fixed: Cancel didn't cancelled (Values were changed)
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Fixed the Machine moving bug when the Machine frame got the focus after
some operations (example:clicking a machine, clicking the arrow of a
combobox and clicking over the machine view again)
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
Instrument change with the arrows correctly changes the instrument in
the instrument dialog.
<br />
<span class="bugfix">!</span>
TPB correctly updated when loading a song.
<br />
Note: This is a maintenance version. It's only aimed to make the usage
of the program easier and less buggy. Psycle 2 is being rebuilt from the
ground up to catch all the bugs (specially VST's related) and make it
even better.
<br />

<br />
