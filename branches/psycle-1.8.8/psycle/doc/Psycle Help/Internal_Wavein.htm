<p class="head2">Wave In Machine</p>
<p>The Wavein Machine is a very simple machine that acts as a door
for audio from an external source. Basically, it will try to record
whatever you have selected in your soundcard mixer as recording source
(microphone, line in, cdrom... ) and send it to the effects you wire it
to.<br/>
With Windows Vista and 7, the recording source is directly selectable
from the Wavein listbox, since these OSes show them differently than in XP.</p>
<p>
This allows to use Psycle as a realtime effect machine (depending on how
much latency your audio card adds).<br />
With ASIO, it only works with stereo sources, so trying to use the
microphone input will result in no input sound.<br/>
Also, note that it will try to use the same bitdepth that is configured for 
output. Some drivers might not support 24 or 32bits for recording but will do
for playback.</p>
