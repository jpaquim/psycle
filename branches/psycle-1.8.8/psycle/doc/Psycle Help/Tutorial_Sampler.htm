<p class="head2">Using Samples</p>

Another type of generator is the Psycle Internal Sampler, which allows
you to use .wav and .iff samples in your songs. First, open the "Add
Machine" window, and in the "Generators" section, select "Sampler" and
click OK. Connect the sampler machine to the master machine.
<p>Now, time to load some samples. Click the <img
	src="sample_load.png" border="0" align="bottom" alt="" /> button to
bring up a dialog box, where you can select your wave sample. You can
load more samples into different sample positions ("instruments") by
clicking the arrow buttons next to the load button, or changing the
position via the combobox.</p>
<p>Is this all? Almost: Select the sample that you want to play You
can select your sample from the drop-down box near the "Load" button,
and then play it using the PC keyboard, just like we did with our
generator. Notice that C-4 is by default the unaltered sample - playing
notes above or below this will play the sample sped up or slowed down
(the pitch will change by the interval difference between the new note
and the default pitch).</p>
<p>For a more in-depth explanation of the sampler, go to <a
