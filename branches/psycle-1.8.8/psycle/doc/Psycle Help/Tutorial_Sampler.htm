<p class=head2>Using Samples</P>

Another type of generator is the Psycle Internal Sampler, which allows you to use .wav and .iff samples in your songs.  First, open the "Add Machine" window, and in the "Generators" section, select "Sampler" and click OK.  Connect the sampler machine to the master machine.
<P>
Now, time to load some samples.  Click the <img src="sample_load.png"border="0" align="absmiddle"> button to bring up a dialog box, where you can select your wave sample.  You can load more samples into different sample positions ("instruments") by clicking the arrow buttons next to the load button, or changing the position via the combobox.<P>
Is this all? Almost: Select the sample that you want to play You can select your sample from the drop-down box near the "Load" button, and then play it using the PC keyboard, just like we did with our generator.  Notice that C-4 is by default the unaltered sample - playing notes above or below this will play the sample sped up or slowed down (the pitch will change by the interval difference between the new note and the default pitch).
<P>
For a more in-depth explanation of the sampler, go to <a href="Sampler.htm">the sampler machine</a> in this help file.
