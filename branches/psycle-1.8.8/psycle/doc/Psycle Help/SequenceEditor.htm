<p class="head1">The Sequence Editor</p>
<p>The Sequence Editor is where you organise your patterns, and is
located on the left side of the Machines window (F2). The song
progresses from top to bottom, and each line in the list holds one
pattern. The number on the left is the position number, and on the right
there is either the pattern name or its number. You may use the same
pattern in more than one position.</p>

<table cellspacing="20">
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b>Plus/Minus</b> &ndash; Increase/Decrease the pattern
		number at the selected position by one.
		<p><b>New</b> &ndash; Create a new pattern with the default
		pattern length in the next position after the current selection.</p>
		<p><b>Clone</b> &ndash; Copies the current selected patterns and
		pastes them with new pattern numbers.</p>
		<p><b>Ins</b> &ndash; Inserts the current selected pattern below
		the current selection, moving the rest of the patterns down by one.</p>
		<p><a name="del"> <b>Del</b></a> (<i>Edit &gt; Sequence Delete</i>)
		&ndash; Deletes the pattern from the list, moving the other patterns
		up by one. Note: This does not delete the <b><i>contents</i></b> of
		the pattern.</p>
		<p><b>Cut</b> (<i>Edit &gt; Sequence Cut</i>) &ndash; Cuts the
		selection to the internal clipboard.</p>
		<p><b>Copy</b> (<i>Edit &gt; Sequence Copy</i>) &ndash; Copies the
		selection to the internal clipboard.</p>
		<p><b>Paste (Above/below)</b> (<i>Edit &gt; Sequence Paste</i>) &ndash; Pastes
		the selection (before or) after the currently selected position.</p>
		<p><b>Rename</b> (<i>Right Click &gt; Rename</i>)&ndash; Allows to change the name of the pattern directly
		from the sequence.</p>
		<p><b>Change</b> (<i>Right Click &gt; Change</i>)&ndash; Allows to change the pattern number by writing 
		it instead of using the plus and minus signs.</p>
		<p><b>Sort</b> &ndash; Sorts all visible patterns by changing
		their numbers to match their position. If a pattern appears multiple
		times, its number will be assigned based on the first instance of it
		e.g. if pattern 03 is in positions 04, 07, and 21, it will be renamed
		to 04.</p>
		<p><b>Clear</b> &ndash; Clears <b><i>ALL</i></b> sequence and
		pattern data - this <b><i>WILL</i></b> erase all your patterns.</p>
		<p><b>Duration</b> &ndash; Indicates the duration in minutes and seconds
		of the song.</p>
		<p>The checkboxes are explained in the <a href="PatternEd_Settings.htm#sequence">pattern editor settings</a>.</p>
