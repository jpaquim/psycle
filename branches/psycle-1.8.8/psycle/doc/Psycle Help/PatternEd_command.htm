<p class="head2">Mcm Command</p>
<p>The Mcm command has evolved to have two different functionalities:</p>
<p class="head3">As MIDI command</p>
<p>
The Mcm command works in a similar way than the Twk Command:
</p>

If the following is a pattern Row,
<br />
<pre>Description: (1) (2)(3) (4)<br />Pattern Row : ---- .. .. ....<br /></pre>

then, on (1) , you insert the Mcm command.
<br />

To do so, you should press Mcm key. Check and/or change its value in the 
<a href="Config_Keyboard.htm">keyboard configuration dialog</a>).
<br />
<br />

On (2) , you define the Midi command number that you want to send.
<br />

You might need to check some MIDI documents and/or the Plugin's help to
know what to write in here. These values are always from 80 to FF.
<br />

<br />

On (3) , you specify the number of the Machine, just like you do with
tweaks.
<br />

This number is the one shown in the combobox, or in the machine's
dialog.
<br />

<br />

Finally, on (4), you specify the Value to send for this midi command.
<br />

<br />

(4) is divided in two groups of two values AABB. You might only need to
speficy AA.
<br />

<br />

Usually, you'll use it to send MIDI CC's. CC Command is "B0".
<br />

Example, this sets the machine volume to half of it:
<br />

<pre>Mcm B0 01 0740<br /></pre>

B0 Send a MIDI CC (Control Change) command to the MIDI channel 0
<br />

01 of the Generator number 1
<br />

07 In order to change it's (Channel) volume
<br />

40 to 40 (in a scale of 0 to 7F, HEX)
<br />

<br />

<p class="head3">As command redirector</p>

The Mcm command can also be used for another purpose. 
It allows to send a command to another track. This way, you can
workaround the limitation where you can only put one of them per
track.
<br />

<br />

Syntax is as follows:
<br />

<br />

If the following is a pattern Row,
<br />

<pre>Description: (1) (2)(3) (4)<br /><br />Pattern Row : ---- .. .. ....<br /><br /></pre>

on (1) , you insert the Mcm command.
<br />

on (2), insert the (pattern) track number where the command will be sent
to (This number will be at much 3F).
<br />

on (3), insert the machine number
<br />

on (4), insert the command that you want to send.
<br />

<br />

Example: Send command 0C50 to track 02 of machine 06:
<br />

<br />
<pre> mcm 02 06 0C50</pre>
