<p class="head2">Note Duplicator</p>
The note duplicator allows you to control more than one machine with a
single machine e.g. to play multiple synths at once using a single
note, or to layer several bass drums together.
<p>
</p>

<p>The different machines are selected on the left-side, and any
note-change is selected on the right (C-5 is the input note). All of
these machines can then be played simultaneously by using the Note
Duplicator as a generator - either by playing notes through it in real
time or entering notes in the <a href="PatternEditor.htm">Pattern Editor</a>.
The Note Duplicator can also be muted or soloed (soloing this machine
will mean that no sound is produced at all, since it only sends
messages to <i><b>OTHER</b></i> machines).
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> This machine does not need to be connected to any other machines to work.
