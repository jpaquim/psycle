<p class="head2">Entering Notes</p>
Notes can be entered via the <a href="Keys.htm#noteLayout">computer keyboard</a> or a
<a href="Config_MIDI.htm">MIDI keyboard</a>
. The actual octave
that is entered into the pattern editor is set in the
<a href="Bars_Songbar.htm">Song Bar</a>
, and can be increased or decreased by pressing "*" or "/" (numeric
keypad) respectively.
<p>Psycle uses the English notation for the note names (See <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note">Wikipedia</a> to see the
correspondence with other notations). This notation uses the first 7
letters of the alphabet as notes.</p>
<p>Notes in psycle look like this:</p>
<center><code>C-4 01 00 0C3F<br />
</code> 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 &nbsp;&nbsp; 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4</center>

<table border="0">
	<col width="25" />
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b>1. </b></td>
		<td>Note name, which can range from <code>C-0</code> to <code>B-9</code>.
		The number represents the octave - <code>C-4</code> is usually the
		same as middle C on the piano (this can sometimes depend on the
		sampler/synthesiser settings).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b>2.</b></td>
		<td>Auxiliary column - This column has two uses, depending on the
		type of note. If it is a tweak, tweak smooth or MIDI command, it determines
		the parameter or command to be sent. When it is a note, it depends on the machine.
		For the Sampler Machine, it indicates which instrument is going to play.<br />
		With VST's, it can be used (it is not required) to specify the MIDI
		channel number (from 0 to F). Other machines like fluidsynth or Yannis MIDI can 
		use this column too to indicate in the same way.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b>3.</b></td>
		<td>Machine number (in hexadecimal).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b>4.</b></td>
		<td>Note parameters - these will depend on your machine. For
		VSTs, the <code>0Cxx</code> command sets the volume at note on, where
		<code>xx</code> is the volume (from 00 to FF). For native machines and
		the internal sampler, refer to their documentation.</td>
	</tr>

<p>When entering notes, make sure the cursor is in the left-hand
side of the track. To edit other parts of the note entry (channel,
machine number, parameter) move using the arrow keys or the mouse.</p>
<p>To enter chords, hold shift and press each note. They will be
placed on the same line, to the right of the cursor.</p>
<p>Unlike other notation systems, note durations will depend on the
volume envelope settings in the machine, and on note-off commands.
Note-off commands send a "note off" signal to the machine, which often
triggers the "release" part of the volume envelope (this depends on the
machine itself). You can enter them using the key "1" over the "Q" key (
on a QWERTY keyboard). It should look like this:</p>
<p />
<center><code> off .. XX .... </code></center>
<p>where <code>XX</code> is the machine number.</p>
<p>Omitting the machine number will send a noteoff command to the
machine that was previously playing in this track. Hitting Ctrl+1 will
enter one of such off commands.</p>
