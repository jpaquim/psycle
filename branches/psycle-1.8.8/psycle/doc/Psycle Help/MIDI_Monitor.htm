<p class="head2">The Midi Monitor</p>
<p>
The MIDI implementation provides a MIDI monitor dialog to
see the current state of Psycle's MIDI interface. The
dialog is shown below with a short explanation of all the values shown:
</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
	<col width="120" />
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b><i>Buffer Used:</i></b></td>
		<td>The amount of MIDI events currently waiting in the internal
		MIDI buffer.</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b><i>Buffer Capacity:</i></b></td>
		<td>The maximum number of MIDI events the internal MIDI buffer
		can hold (currently fixed at 1024).</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b><i>Events Lost:</i></b></td>
		<td>The number of MIDI events purged (not played) from the
		internal MIDI buffer. This usually happens when there is a "drop-out"
		in the audio pipe-line and the MIDI interface decides that the events
		should be discarded rather than played (because they probably have
		been delayed too much).</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b><i>MIDI Headroom:</i></b></td>
		<td>How much "MIDI slack" is being allowed to account for delayed
		MIDI messages getting to Psycle (set in the configuration dialog).</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b><i>Internal MIDI Version:</i></b></td>
		<td>The descriptor of the currently running Psycle MIDI interface
		code.</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><i><b>Sync Event Latency:</b></i></td>
		<td>The amount of milliseconds the MIDI Sync Start message was
		delayed.</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b><i>Sync Adjust:</i></b></td>
		<td>The amount of samples Psycle has accounted for to bring its
		audio engine in line with the incomming MIDI data. A negative value
		here means that some notes may have been purged from the MIDI buffer
		to regain sync (not too good). A positive value here means that Psycle
		had time to wait until it needed to start playing the received MIDI
		data (good).</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b><i>Sync Offset:</i></b></td>
		<td>The current amount of milliseconds that the Psycle audio
		engine has "lagged" behind the incomming MIDI. This typically should
		start around 0 and then being greater (negative) if the audio engine
		"drops-out" at any point. This value is used internally to keep the
		audio engine in sync with an external MIDI sequencer.</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b><i>Psycle MIDI active?</i></b></td>
		<td>Is Psycle using the MIDI input?</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b><i>Receiving MIDI data?</i></b></td>
		<td>Is Psycle receiving any MIDI data, either on the main device
		or the sync device?</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b><i>Syncronising:</i></b></td>
		<td>Is Psycle currently syncronising the audio engine with the
		incomming MIDI?</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b><i>Resync Triggered?</i></b></td>
		<td>Has a resync been triggered because the audio engine has been
		restarted? (e.g. when a new plug-in is created)</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b><i>Emulated Track Tick?</i></b></td>
		<td>Has Psycle received a tracker tick? (CC 123, DATA 1-127 -
		simulates a tracker line change)</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b><i>MIDI Sync Start/Clock/Stop:</i></b></td>
		<td>Has Psycle received one of these MIDI sync messages?</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b><i>Emualted Sync Start/Clock/Stop:</i></b></td>
		<td>Has Psycle received one of the emulated sync messages? (CC
		121, 122 &amp; 124)</td>

	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b><i>Ch 1-16:</i></b></td>
		<td>Shows the data received for each MIDI channel (included ALL
		types of data).</td>

	</tr>
</table>
<p>The channel-mapping table is self-explanatory. The Noteoff column indicates if noteoff commands will get accepted
by Psycle (yes), or will get discarded (no). This can be switched with <a href="MIDI_Chart.htm">MIDI messages</a></p>
