<p>Use the arrow buttons to switch between samples, the textbox to
rename them, and the "Kill" button to delete them.</p>

<b>New Note Action</b> &ndash; Whether to cut, release or do nothing
when another note from the same machine is triggered while the previous
note is still playing.
<p><b>Panning</b> &ndash; The left or right channel bias of the
sample. 128 is the middle.</p>
<p><b>Random Panning</b> &ndash; Randomises the panning each time
the sample is played.</p>
<p><b>Random VCF Cutoff</b> &ndash; Randomises the <a href="#filter">filter</a>
cutoff each time the sample is played.</p>
<p><b>Random Reso/Bw.</b> &ndash; Randomises the resonance of the
filter each time the sample is played.</p>
<p class="head3">Tempo Looping Tool</p>

<b>Play sample to fit X rows</b> &ndash; Stretches or squashes the
sample to fit a given number of rows. 
<p class="head3"><a name="wavelayer">Instrument Wave Layer</a></p>

<b>Volume</b> &ndash; Volume of the sample.
<p><b>FineTune</b> &ndash; Finetuning of the pitch of the sample by
a maximum of +/- one semitone.</p>
<p><b>Tune</b> &ndash; Sets the base tuning of the note. The
original pitch of the sample is set to C-4, so if the tuning of a given
sample were set to C-5, the pitch of the sample is shifted up by one
octave.</p>
<p><b>Loop</b> &ndash; To turn on the loop set in the <a
	href="Sampler_WaveEditor.htm">wave editor</a>, click "Forward". Click
the "Off" button to ignore the loop settings.</p>
<p><b>Loop At</b> &ndash; Displays the loop points that have been
set in the <a href="Sampler_WaveEditor.htm">wave editor</a>.</p>
<p class="head3">Amplitude/Filter Envelopes</p>

(click on the Amplitude/Filter Envelopes button)
<p><b>Amplitude</b> &ndash; This modifies the ADSR
(Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release) envelope for the volume, which is shown
on a graph. To ignore the volume settings, set the Attack, Decay and
Release to the lowest value possible, and set the Sustain to 100%.</p>
<p><a name="filter"> <b>Filter</b></a> &ndash; This modifies the
ADSR envelope for the filter.</p>
<p><b>Filter Parameters</b> &ndash; This allows you to set the
filter cut-off frequency, the Q (resonance) and the percentage effect of
the filter envelope on the sample.</p>
<p><b>Filter Mode</b> &ndash; This allows you to set the filter
type. You have a choice of Low Pass (retains only the freqencies below
the cufoff), High Pass (retains only the freqencies above the cutoff),
Band Pass (retains only a band of frequencies above and below the
cutoff) and Notch (rejects only a band of frequencies above and below
the cutoff). To ignore any filter settings, set this to "None".</p>
