<p class="head3">General Questions</p>

<p><b>Q)</b> I need to talk to the developers!<br>

<b>A)</b> Via E-mail:<br>

</p>

<ul>

  <li> Write to the mailing list:
psycle-devel@lists.sourceforge.net<br>

  </li>

  <li> You can also contact with the developers using the e-mails
listed here :<br>

    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/memberlist.php?group_id=10384">http://sourceforge.net/project/memberlist.php?group_id=10384</a><br>

DO NOT WRITE to those with "No Specific Role". They are Retired.<br>

Most probably, you want to talk to JosepMa/jaz, or johan_boule/bohan
  </li>

</ul>

Via IRC:<br>

<ul>

  <li> Use an IRC client to connect to *EFnet* network, and
there, to the
#psycle channel.<br>

  </li>

  <li> use the web based interfaces at: http://psycle.free.fr/irc<br>

  </li>

</ul>

<p><b>Q)</b>Is it possible to import/load
MOD/S3M/XM/IT files into Psycle?<br>

<b>A)</b> Latest 1.7.x alphas and all 1.8 versions include
"Sampulse" and its importing routines.
Those should allow you to import them with ease.<br>

Warnings:<br>

</p>

<ul>

  <li> Sampulse as a machine is unfinished. You
might preffer replacing it
by other native/VST
machines after having imported the patterns/sequence.</li>

  <li> Also, note that Psycle has an important
limitation : It does not have
a volume column, so all the volume changes are converted to a volume
command, making it impossible to have a volume set and a command at the
same line.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Q)</b> What is this 'dummy'
machine?<br>

<b>A)</b> Dummy internal machine? It is mainly used to
replace missing plugin
machines when loading
a .psy file. It can also be used to group machines, connecting them to
it, and avoid a
limitation that exists of max 12 machines connected to one.
</p>

<p><b>Q)</b> I have problems
playing a song in Winamp!<br>

<b>A)</b> The winamp plugin hasn't been updated for long,
and it lacks several
changes that have
been since then. We no longer recommend using it, until we release an
up-to-date version.

<p class="head3"><b>Samples and the Sampler
Machine</b></p>

<p><b>Q)</b> I've loaded a sample
but it doesn't make any sound.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> To play a
sampled sound (.wav or .iff only!) you need to add a
sampler machine and connect
it to the master or to an effect that goes to the master. You might
want to check if other
machines make sound, and check your audio settings.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
Can Psycle use OGG?/MP3? files as samples?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span>
Unfortunately not. This is a common question, because it would be
good. Support for lossy
compression (MP3?, etc) and lossless compression? (FLAC, etc) formats
is on the TODO list.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
When I load a sample and enter a note, it's really fast and
high-pitched...<br>

...when it plays. I've tried everything from halving the bit rate of
the sample to re-installing Psycle.
What should I do about this?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> The way
trackers change pitch of a sample is by speeding up or
slowing down the rate at which
the individual sample points are played back. The result is similar to
playing a 33 1/3 RPM
record at 45, or vice versa.<br>

This depends on the note you press, and
for the Sampler, the
"standard" note is C-4, not C-5 like with most other plugins. Also, you
can adjust the base
note to another value, via the Edit instruments screen (Edit button in
the toolbar, or F10 key)</p>

<p class="head3"><b>Psycle Usage</b></p>

<p><b>Q)</b> When Psycle loses focus, the music
stops. Why?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> The
"Exclusive" mode is selected in the Directsound Configuration.<br>

Go to the Configuration
Menu -&gt; Settings and select the Input/output tab, and press the
configure button.
There you will see the Exclusive option. Uncheck it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
I've put my xxx VST plugin in the "plugins" dir and Psycle doesn't
show it!<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> Psycle
uses a different paths for Native plugins and VST plugins. By
default, Native Plugins go
under "Plugins\" and VST's go under "Vst\".<br>

If you want to change it,
go to Configure-Settings,
select the "Directories" tab, and select your VST plugins' dir.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
Why doesn't/Can't/won't Psycle support buzz machines?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> Oskari
Tammelin, the author of Buzz, declined us the right to
develop a Buzz Plugins' Host for Psycle.<br>

Recently, some wrappers are being developed for other projects. Psycle
is keeping an eye on those
and in the future we could use one of those in it</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
I can't enter notes into the Pattern Editor. What happens?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> The Edit
Mode is Deactivated. The default key to switch it on/off is
the "Space" key. You can see if
you are on Edit mode in the status bar, to the right.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
What is the Red Circle Button in the toolbar for?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> It allows
you to enter Record Notes in realtime mode.<br>

To enter this
mode Follow Song and Edit mode
have to be activated so when you enable Record Notes in realtime,
Follow Song and Edit mode are
activated automatically if they were disabled.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
I have only 16 tracks in my psycle song, how do i get 64?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> Under the
save icon (the diskette), there is a track number
selector. Unfold the list of tracks number
and select 64.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
What does the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Autostop
All Machines</span> button exactly do?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> When
enabled, if Psycle detects an effect that receives no sound
input, it stops it, freeing CPU usage.
This is beneficial in most cases, but plugins like delays, or those
that have LFO's or any other parameter
that needs to run constantly, will sound unexpectedly.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
How do I change the pattern length?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> Right
Click in the Pattern Window and then select&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Properties.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
Is it possible to have&nbsp;patterns with different lengths?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> See
above: "How do I change the pattern length?"</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
How does the tweak_smooth command work?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> In the
docs-Directory you find a .txt-file with in-depth info about
tweaking.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
Is it possible to let a tws command affect several rows (not only
one)?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> Smooth
tweaks between two tweak values can be achieved by entering
the start and the end value,
selecting via mouse the region and then select "Interpolate" from the
context-menu.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
how do I stop a synth playing in a track/ how do i create a NoteOff?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> put the
cursor in a channel's first column, the row you want it to
stop and press&nbsp;1.
This will put an "off", silencing the machine at that point. You can
also press Ctrl+1 to insert an off without machine number, so that the
last machine used in this track would be stopped.<br>

<p class="head3"><b>Development</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
How can I develop a Psycle Machine?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> There is
no SDK yet, and format will change in Psycle 2.<br>

The recommended way right now is to get the source directly of one of
the open source plugins ( arguru synth is a good start ), and use it as
a template
for your own.
You can download them from Psycle's SVN repository at Source Forge
Site:
https://psycle.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/psycle/trunk/psycle-plugins/</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
How can I port a Buzz machine to Psycle?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> An old
SDK exists in the download section of Psycle in Sourceforge,
but it is
obsolete. The only way there is right now is starting with a Psycle
plugin.<br>

M3 Would be your start point, since it is partially documented.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
I would like to contribute to the project. What can I do?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> Psycle
evolves continuously, and sometimes it is thanks small
contributions from
people not involved directly with it.
You can contact the developers (See first Question of this FAQ) and ask
what could
you do, or tell us what you'd like to work on instead: DSP, plugins, help
files, graphics, tracker features... There are lots of places that can be improved in
one way or another.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q)</span>
When will Psycle 2 be out?/ In which stage is Psycle 2 developement?
What do you
plan for Psycle 2?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> See the
