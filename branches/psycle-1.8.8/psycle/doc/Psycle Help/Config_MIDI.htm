<p>This screen allows to change the meaning of the MIDI messages received
by Psycle and do a different action instead.</p>
<p>The two dropdown boxes of Set Generator and Set Instrument configure in
which way Psycle will know the generator and/or instrument that is
going to receive the message.<br/>
Example: If it is set "by Program change", then
the messages received in the same MIDI channel will be sent to the machine
indicated by the MIDI Program Change message received. (This is the original
behaviour of the Synchronized mode)<br/>
If it is set at "Currenty selected in Psycle", then, any message received
will always go to the generator and/or instrument selected in the 
machine dropdown box in the main toolbar. (This is the original behaviour
of the Immediate mode)</p>
<p>The setting for Record Raw MIDI as mcm does not try to apply any of the
controller mappings below (except the Velocity map) and sends instead
an mcm command directly to the machine, who is responsible to understand it.</p>
<p>The Map velocity option tells which command to use for the note on command
as well as the velocity MIDI command.</p>
<p>The Map pitch option allows to map the Pitch message (the wheel in many MIDI
keyboards) to a command.</p>
<p>The rest of the Maps are user configurable and will have an effect only if
the "Record Raw MIDI as mcm" is unchecked.</p>
<p>To map a command to a parameter, type its number in the leftmost
box (this is the MIDI CC number - read your synthetiser's manual for
more details). Then, select the function you want to use, and specify
the minimum and maximum values of the function (this means that your
controller's input will be scaled between the two values). They behave
as follows:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
	<col width="120" />
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><b>Function</b></td>
		<td><b>Translates the MIDI CC into:</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><code>cmd</code></td>
		<td>Internal machine commands - read your plugin's manual for
		details.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><code>twk/tws</code></td>
		<td>Tweak/Tweak Smooth Smooth - the value to the right of the
		drop-down box is the parameter number.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr valign="top">
		<td><code>mcm</code></td>
		<td>Raw mcm command.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Note: The Synchronized mode does also offer a dynamic mapping set by sending
MIDI commands. See the CC 126 and CC127 on the <a href="MIDI_Chart.htm">MIDI chart</a></p>
