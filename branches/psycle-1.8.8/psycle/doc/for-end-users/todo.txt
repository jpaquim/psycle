+ ghost note : http://psycle.pastnotecut.org/thread.php?threadid=1894&boardid=2&styleid=1
	[JosepMa: Done for VST's. Sampulse implements it, sampler doesn't. And natives would need it implemented one-by-one]

------------ <kSh> -------------
1)
For you, I have a little idea - trivial to do, very important to the users. Let Psycle save files to another name, then check if the file is OK, and then delete the old one and rename the new one.
Paranoia for Psycle  	From kSh on 26.05.2004, 23:06 to BJohan
Paranoia works well and if I get no problems with it through the upcoming weekend I'll release it with full source code in C++ Builder. Still I have a question: I would be able to overwrite the autosave settings in Psycle by modifying the registry with Paranoia but the Autosave options are shown as "Incorrect DWORD values" in regedit. What are they then?
Regards,
kSh

** MIDI clock sync - does it work, or is it unsupported?

////////////////////
<GabeCrowe> in the pattern view.
<GabeCrowe> when i hold a hot key modifier. and hover my mouse over a note. i want it to fade in. and fade out when i let go. so i can hear it, without pressing play.
<GabeCrowe> and quickly find a note in a haze of patterns.
<GabeCrowe> thats not complicated is it?
<GabeCrowe> and, so that samples, of voice and such split over the patterns, can be easily located.

++ <sampler> Show with a different colour the notes of the current Generator/effect in patterns


//////////////////////





+++ in the wire dialog display what value the current vol is in terms of FCxx, also wire vols cannot be changed past 0.0 via tweaks
++ <pooplog> vus in wire dialogs should display peak values (and if you really want to be smart, rms)

++ undos for wave edit? 

*** <alk_> when Psycle is open hibernate does not work (windows crashes)

*** when you drag pan handle over transparency, it leaves trails.

++ volume slide command

+ humanizer
+ global volume fades
+ <bdzld> poop: can you make mcm interpolated? (like a midi tweak smooth)
	[-problem of knowing what current value is-]
+ the ability to define the vol of the sample previewing would be excellent, at the moment you must alter the vol every time manually

+ add an editing mode that does not enter the istrument or machine

+ <alk> some bastards want keyrepeat for notes back
+ save bar hide/unhide settings

+ I agree that final output should be limited
	[ it is when you have the decrease flag set ]

+ i was wondering if it is possible to make a header skin that indicates when a track creates an output?? (like those small vu meters at the headers in mp-tracker, or something)

?+ Recording to clipboard: a checkbox in the save file dialog - something like 'save to clipboard' which will copy to windows clipboard the file thats just been saved
	[50MB to clipboard? ehem...]

Machines
========

**	JAL7OH- JMdrum.dll crashes psycle (or gets muted) when using FBxx and/or FAxx.
**	JMDrum is buggy (Crashes after changing settings sometimes)
**                <lobyaway> ah, it bugs if i hold down a note while editing (to fill the pattern with notes)
**	<_sue_> are there any bugless ported machines? m3 in 22050 mode just makes a click..nothing more....
**	routing in pooplog synths for vcf->od modes only works when both vcfs are active?
**  clicking in pooplog synths when vca sustain is off
**  pooplog delay panning knobs fuck with my brain because they work counter-intuitively
!	James says: i noticed that the appegiator in the lab causes constant retriggering of VCA
+	pooplog synths don't have gain lfo phase cmd?
+	alk/[JAZ] Add Osci/etc from wire dialog to Master Dialog.
+	<pooplog> it would be nice to have an internal wavein machine to get live input
		<Druttis> Yes
		<trylle> i mean that it records and plays back at the same time * record wave in too

===============
Sampulse Machine
===============

+FF	Instruments Support ( *.xi , *.iti, *.sf2. Maybe more)
		 * maybe: samples mapped by velocity?
+	Improve Filter support.
		 * twk Control
		 * maybe: allow filter cutoff/res mapping to velocity

===========
Wave Editor
===========

!	alk: escape to close wave ed
		[JAZ : It's a window, not a dialog]
+	ALK waveed: remove silence from start and end of wave
+	Mystic - import .mp3 format for samples
+	Easier way to load Samples.
+	better way to set loop points. (+ ping-pong loops)


=============
GUI (pattern)
=============

*	<alk> somehow I managed to get the row number highlighted in two places.
		to cause the bug of more than one line number highlighted:
		select a line, then lower down click and drag to select a block.
		cause the window to scroll by making the block go off the Bottom of the screen.
		(notice the previous highlight moving up) now click another place.
		[pooplog - cannot reproduce]
+ <iliks> option to switch off effects column when you want thus obtaining more screen space for channels
+	option to see waveform instead of notes in pattern editor for acid mode
+	D says: maybe have some of the effects in a drop down or available by right clicking
+	Xerox replace, allow multiple - it replaces the selected pattern(s) with an identical new one
+	Xerox multiple
+	In FT2, the cursor Jumps to the top of a pattern when you move from one to another (Kris)
+	maybe: MultiPattern View (see the previous pattern at top and the next at bottom, like if it was continuous)

==============
GUI (machines)
==============

**	alk:  note gets stuck bug, open a machine dialog, play a note, move the machine window,
		before releasing mouse button release note, then release mouse.
		[Could it be InputHandler::KeyToCmd() not understanding the key because of the mouse button?]
		[KeyToCmd() isn't called when a mouse button is down... ]
*	When changing octave, notes playing should be stopped (because if not, notes playing don't stop)
		[Problem!!! All key processing is done by InputHandler, so machines don't know when it happens,
		 and neither does Inputhandler know which machines are playing.
		 Doing a "player::Stop()" would be a bit hardcore.
		 I agree]
*	moving machines makes playback pop - machine interface takes too long to redraw, and moving causes redraw
		on every frame -
		[ make bigger buffers and more of them to prevent this from happening * i tried to minimize this ]
*	<bdzld> when you put a machine on top of each other, the vus always pop to the top?
		[ could try to set up some sort of clipping rect stack, at the cost of cpu... ]
*	<alk> move mouse over vu, black flickering (more noticable on the big vus)* transparent only i think
		[ this is perhaps a flaw in the transparency blit algo? - should port to ddraw ]


+++    Create a new "universal" MachineFrame class, for all plugins including all the following things:
          		(Needs a few more changes in the class definitions)
*	cannot preview with keyboards in preset dialog
!!	machine param enter dialog should be modeless.
		[[JAZ] Why? What do you want to do meanwhile?]
		[<pooplog> play notes to test parameter]
+	<_sue_> native mahcines gui should have sliders...it would change a lot....
		<pooplog> sliders, switches, and owner draw controls i say?
+	Directories in "Add new machine" (Sorting with directories)
		 Remember previous used and add "class/type" selection to registry
+	James says: how hard would it be to put nodes in the wires, so you can bend them?


=============
Player Engine
=============

++	<sue> playbar should take latency into account
+++	<Alk^> do u think the recording with subtracting the buffer delay will be doable? - use fdxx command
+++	option for note-record to take command FD into account like ft2
+FF?	DirectX effects, intstruments
++FF	DocBexter: (machine interface) and it urgently needs 3. control/read of parameters of other
		machines ....
+	alk: global Delay Trigger, that affects every note (not just the one on this channel)
		[this seems hard, because the player will have to scan all tracks for this command, then go back and
		play the tracks
		We already do this for twk's, we could check one more command. Still, a dedicated global column
		is a better solution.]
+FF	Angelus: <pooplog>Adding panning to the wire dialog would be very easy, other than the changes to
		file format.  Psycle could be sneaky and just store it as a leftvol rightvol and convert to
		vol+panning for the gui for the user.
+AF 	I am thinking on using the unused "aux" column for the "off" note ( key "1" as you mention)
		to allow the user to speficy a "different than default" fadeout.
		[JosepMa: It sounds as a good idea. The only question is which scale should it use]

====
Vsts
====
Note: Many of these are previous to switching to the Seib-based VSThost in 1.8.5.

***	songs saved with quadrasid sometimes freak out after loading...
**  	Waldorf PPG WAVE 2.V VSTI : psycle misses/skips notes ramdomly - to check this fill in all 64 
		pattern ticks with notes and press play - ive tried this plug with aodix and it worked fine.
*** 	if you have more than 1 stereo out selected on dr008, it can crash psycle.
*** 	Speedsoft Virtual Sampler VSTI : open the plug's gui and click "view" -> "Rack view". the plug 
		will change its gui to rack view (wich is a smaller window). close the plugs gui. reopen the gui; 
		the plug will crash with : "Acess violation at adress 0047F99C in module 'psycle.exe'. 
		Read of adress 00000038" This crash happens with more plugs wich change the size of their gui.
** 	Biskmark BS-16 VSTI (soundfont player) (and prolly BS-1 also) - when loading a track using BS-16 i 
		get a window saying : "Error : file open". this windows has an "ok" button bellow. i click "ok" 
		and the soundfont is loaded into BS-16. if i use 3 soundfonts in a song i have to click "ok" 3 
		times. An old version of psycle had the same problem. This problem was fixed in psycle 1.6 release 
		(i think, note really sure of the ver). Now it reapeared with the new file format. This is the only 
		bug im reporting that only happens in the latest beta 1.7.3 [May-16-2003]. all the previous
		reports happened since previous versions.
** 	BLOCKFISH crashes on connect
** 	DashSynthesis daAlfa2k VSTi v1.28b - crashes with user breakpoints and access violation on instance in debug build
**	 phatmatic causes crashes when you open the gui after loading a sample into it.
		[ also, when opening/closing the directory pane, it tries to change the window size and does a poor job.
		  after a few tries it fucks up.  if you re-open it after it has fucked up, it crashes. ]
** 	<photonamp> i dont understand why sampletank notes are getting stuck in v1.7rc5 and while in 1.66
		it works fine?
**	JAL7OH- reaktor 3.05 - psy crashes on exiting when reaktor is loaded;
		docked toolbars in reaktor are invisible when running as a vst plug in psycle so to become visible
		again i had to run reaktor in buzz (where they are visible) undock them and then run reaktorvst in psycle;
**	psycle crashes when i get the 'cpu overload' warning in reaktor 3.05
** 	reaktor 4.0 has gui problems, including the wrong parameter being changed by the mouse?
**	<_sue_> bug with native intruments pro-52 it doesnt rec the tweaks at all.....
		<pooplog> are you able to control the tweaks of it from the pattern?
		<_sue_> yes i am (in pro52)
		[ How does those plugins do Automation then? Maybe it is a Host fault not reporting that it supports it? ]
**	 <_sue_> hey.....remember seeing someone at the boards sayn that psycles param bar went crazy with
		 some plug.....im checking NI FM7 vsti.......with haves 881 params.......when i tweak a knob
	 	sometimes the param bar takes ages to get to its postion.......maybe this is what he was
		 talking about......the first time it happened it scrolled for ages..i thought it had went
	 	crazy too.....
**	ni fm7 locks up psycle on parameter change midi command with gui open
**	 ni pro53 sometimes crashes when loading a song that uses it.
**	 ni spektral delay 1.0 crashes on effClose or effEditIdle messages.  notice a trend with NI plugins yet?
**	 stylus locks up on fast songs, with looping sound
*	JAL7OH- vsampler3 vsti doesnt draw its popups and undocked windows properly
		 (im experiencing the same problems with all previous releases alpha1,2 and beta1,2 of vsampler)
*	New Note in Quadrasid does not reinitialize the Envelope.
		[ Bug? This doesn't happen on freebase]
*	many vsts freeze the childview from updating while Left mouse button is down, which makes it so pattern does
		not draw, so it appears that tweak recording is not working, such as:
		-juno X2
		-externalizer
		-leveler
		-tools one
* 	sonic syndicate plugins (talkbox and phaser) get enumerated as plucked string
+++FF	<bdzld> which is support for multiout vsti?
		<pooplog> if psycle was smart enough to detect mutli-out vst, when you drag a wire to it, it could pop up a
		dialog asking what you ouput want it to connect to - this will require a file format change though :(

============
MIDI related
============

++	MIDI out
++	midi control commands learn
++	midi control commands handling 14 bit messages
+	<lastfutur> future feature requests for the controllers tab: midi routing presets;
	checkbox: binding which machine is active to incoming program changes;
	binding midi routing presets to machines; (possibly: save the presets in the psy)
---------- nolwenn -------------

About the MIDI CC : now that they are transmitted directly as MCM it could be nice to replace the old "midi controllers" setting windows and implement a MIDI learn (like in chainer standalone) for VSTs that are not cc mapped.

======================================
Interface (contains pattern stuff too)
======================================
*	If the song directory is incorrect/invalid, cloning machines doesn't work
		[one option is to not store a .psy, and work completely in memory for cloning]
* <bdzld> the icon for play doesn reset the status if the stream doesnt open <pooplog> like of WME is busy or something?
	<bdzld> yep, or if the sample rate is invalid
* <alk> the bug where the pattern ed loses focus * what got the focus was the sequencer button (clone I think)
	[ same thing, pattern ed looses focus ]
	[ easy way to reproduce, click a button and move the mouse out without leaving. button gets selected, but event
	 hasn't happened so it remains there ]
*	Numeric 0 to stop song could be used in 1.66, but in 1.7, it puts the value if its not in
	in the "note" column.
	[Is it useful to enter numbers while playing and follow song? what about just adding notes
	 wherever the position of the cursor is?]
!!	Should make it so clicking on colour boxes pops up menu
!!	<pooplog> i mean follow song, multi aud, noteoffs, tweaks, etc. could be buttons perhaps
!	JAL7OH- the cycle length in the swing fill dialog set to lines per beat/2 by default
++	<_sue_> something like selecting a generator and having some global edit functions (in the edit menu :)
		like :  delete all notes / tranpose all + 12 / delete all tweaks .....stuff like this *for the entire song*
++	<sue> hotkeys for seq edit cut, copy, paste, etc?
+	<bd|cup> poop: could you add an option to make psycle load the last opened .psy, when you run it?
+	<sampler> Well, i've been playing and changing default hotkeys and now i think it would be good
		enhance this feature.  I think the hotkeys list/dialog should show them in a better way, various
		types of sorting, show the complete keys assigned (larger textbox)  , allow printing it....
+	James says: i have an idea for that actually... seeing as there are so many configurable
		keys... could perhaps have a textbox, where if you clicked in there, typed a key, it would highlight
		what was assigned to it
+	<Alk> to be able to drop a play markers (start and end) to loop through to make editing easier
+	<Alk> +alt to make the transposing only effect current machine/sample
		i.e. ctrl+alt+f11 = transpose current gen/sample down 1 note
		ctrl+alt+shift+f12 = transpose current gen/sample up 1 octave
+	<alk_> the 'Apply' button is not implemented in the config dialog
+	<alk> make it so that you can click anywhere on the wire to get wire vol? (in case triangle is hidden)
+	<sue> <pooplog> so please explain to me exactly what sequence mix paste button would do- it would mix-paste data
		into the currently selected blocks? <sue> yes it would work as pattern mix paste for more than one pattern.
+	<wayfinder> alk, oh oh and another one :D it would be cool if you could, for example with alt-0 through
		9, change the row skip
+	<wayfinder> numeric entering of pattern number
+?	<wayfinder> it would be so much cooler if there were like macros
		say, i have a chorus part that's pattern 4, 6, 4, 5 and i have that three times in the song or so
		i'd love to define pattern macro A as "4, 6, 4, 5" and be able to enter macro A in the
		pattern sequencer
+ 	<Fabrice> a button (or many ones) to clean the unused samples, patterns, machines, effect etc....
+	 MORE Keyboard shortcuts
		[ We've added some more actually]
		[ and most the needed ones are listed up there ^^ ]


=========
Importing
=========

++ 	.mid import/export
+	Import machines from song - the (regular) .psy is loaded without erasing the already loaded song ignoring
		pattern data and other settings, this possible? (yes, but will require new song parser...)
+ 	<angelus> In this thread I suggest an option to import a XM or IT file into differents
		Sampler-machines separating by instrument/sample.

===========
File Format
===========

+	should save wire dialog settings
		[ are you sure? ]
+++FF	new file format: (vst multi-out, volume column, direct x stuff, etc.)

====================
Editing Capabilities
====================
	+ Multi pattern Sequencing
	+ Multiple Editors (Not only tracker view)
	+ Parameter Automation  ( Envelopes for Parameters )
	+ Velocity/Panning/other_weird column to pattern data
	+ Appregiator: One "template" note, notes "produced" by the appregiator in a different colour.
	+ "zip"-able columns.

	? Maybe notes/etc, of muted machines shown in grey
	? Time signatures

========
Machines
========

=============
Audio/Control
=============

	+ "MIDI Controlling <-> Machine <-> Machine" Interface = MIDI mapping
		  (allow to map midi commands to change different parameters)
	+ Ogg/Winamp Plugin export?
