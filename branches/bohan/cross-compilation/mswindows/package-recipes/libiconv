	# Notes from http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv
	#
	# After installing GNU libiconv for the first time, it is recommended to recompile and reinstall GNU gettext,
	# so that it can take advantage of libiconv.
	#
	# On systems other than GNU/Linux, the iconv program will be internationalized
	# only if GNU gettext has been built and installed before GNU libiconv.
	#
	# This means that the first time GNU libiconv is installed, we have a circular dependency
	# between the GNU libiconv and GNU gettext packages, which can be resolved by building and installing either
	# * first libiconv, then gettext, then libiconv again,
	# or (on systems supporting shared libraries, excluding AIX)
	# * first gettext, then libiconv, then gettext again.
