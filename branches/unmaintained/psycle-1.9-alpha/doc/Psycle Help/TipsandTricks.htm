<ul>
<li> Press Ctrl + Tab to expand the pattern editor/machine view, and again to shrink it.
<li> Save a new copy of your file each time you make a major change - if you don't like it, you can easily go back to the old file.

<p class=head3>Machine View</p>
<ul>
<li>Group machines together, either with a gainer plugin or a mastering plugin e.g. a compressor, to simplify your connections to the <a href="Machine_Master.htm">Master Machine</a> and avoid going of the limit of 12 connections.
<li>You can <a href="Machine_Wires.htm">monitor</a> more than one connection at once - just double click on each wire that you want to monitor, and drag the windows to make them all visible at once.
<li>Instead of just connecting a generator through an effect and then straight to the second effect, connect a second wire directly from the generator to the second effect.  Then, set the wet signal of the effect to 100%.  Do this with several generators and the same effect, and the wet and dry signal volumes for each generator can be easily changed, using the wires that leave each generator.  This works well where processing of the invidual signals is not needed later on in the chain.
<li>When you only want to listen to several generators at once, solo one of them, then unmute the others.
<li>In the Machine View, rename the machines that you've inserted into your song from the default names to make them more meaningful - "Main saw synth" is more useful than "reFX Vanguard 5".

<ul>
<li>You can import patterns from a different project - just save them as <a href="FileFunc_psb.htm">.psb</a> files using the <a href="FileFunc_New.htm">Save</a> command and then open them in your new file.	
<li>Edit the names of your samples in the <a href="Sampler_InstrumentEditor.htm">Instrument Editor</a> to make them more meaningful instead of things like "bd_sample_1065.wav".
<li>Percussion samples (or any samples for that matter) can be played at different pitches to produce some useful sounds.
<li>Be consistent with your tracks - keep the same set of instruments/synths in a particular track number.  It will help you to keep more organised, and make it easier to go back and change various parts.
<li>When you only want to listen to a few elements, click the solo button for one of the tracks, and unmute the others.
<li>You can play one note or one row at a time - make sure the cursor is in the note-part of the track, and press 4 or 8 respectively (these shortkeys can be changed, of course).
