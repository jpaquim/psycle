=================================

Instrument - global params for entire instrument:

-volume
-global tune
-global fine tune
-portamento speed
-new note action type (note off, cut, continue, crossfade, etc.)
-pan - main pan
        - pitch pan amount (%/octave)
        - pan_pitch center note
-number of filters (0-4) * could be overkill
-number of shapers (0-4) * could be overkill
-number of lfos (0-32)
-number of envelopes (0-255)
-number of velocity splits (1-16)
-number of samples (0-255)
-lfo data[0->number of lfos]
-envelope data[0->number of envelopes] * this allows a tracker command to pick envelopes
-filter data[0->number of filters]
-shapter data[0->number of shapers]
-velocity split data [0->number of splits, stored incrementally from lowest split to highest]
-sample header data [0->number of samples]
-sample data [0->number of samples]

================================

LFO data

-lfo assignment (off, finetune, tune, vol, pan, cutoff, resonance, , stereo phase offset, offset, both offset, lfo X
depth, lfo X rate, etc...)
-waveform (sine, square, saw, triangle, random)
-rate
-depth

================================

Filter Data

- type
- mixing method
- routing position
- cutoff
- resonance
- cutoff "follow note" amount (ie cutoff = note freq + cutoff param) %/octave
- cutoff "follow note" center note

================================

Shaper Data

- type
- routing position
- gain

================================

Envelope data

-envelope assignment (off, volume, panning, pitch, filter, etc.)
-number of points (0 if no envelope)
-loop point
-loop to point
-loop mode (off, repeat, sustain) - points can loop to selves, sustain point
stops looping on noteoff
-loop type (forward, reverse, pingpong)
-point data [0->number of points], must be stored sorted by time, first
point must be at time 0

================================

Envelope Point data
-amplitude
-time

================================

Velocity split - global params across velocity split
-volume (applied across entire split to compensate for velocity)
-max velocity (for this split)
-sample keymap (array from c-0 to b-9 of keyinfo)

================================

Keyinfo
-sample number
-pitch to map to

================================

Sample Header data
-volume
-panning
-tune
-finetune
-number of beats in sample
-offset (into sample, msec)
-stereo phase offset (into sample, msec)
-stretch bpm for sample
-stretch sample duration (msec)
-duration stretch mode - (none, use stretch bpm and # beats, use song sync
and # beats,  use stretch sample duration value, use original sample rate) -
this is for loops, works like acid, requires a pitch shifter for most modes
-pitch shift mode - (off, pitch algorithm selections) (only used if duration
stretch mode is on)
-sample loop start
-sample loop end
-loop mode (off, repeat, sustain) - points can loop to selves, sustain point
stops looping on noteoff
-loop type (forward, reverse, pingpong)

===================================

Sample Data
just use WAV format

===================================


re: envelope gui:
<_sue_> it would be very nice if you could set the size of the "place" where you draw the points.....like you could set it to 64 ticks/lines or something....
<SCK|> just a though, it would be nice to have an ability to mix several sample streams. do some math operation between them , add sub mul ,
RX style beatslicer mode
