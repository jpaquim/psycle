=================================

Instrument - global params for entire instrument:

-volume
-global tune
-global fine tune
-portamento speed
-new note action type (note off, cut, continue, crossfade, etc.)
-filter - type
        - cutoff
        - resonance
        - cutoff "follow note" toggle (ie cutoff = note freq + cutoff param)
-pan - main pan
        - pitch pan toggle
        - pan_pitch_1
        - pan at pan_pitch_1
        - pan_pitch_2
        - pan at pan_pitch_2
-lfo 1 - assignment (off, finetune, tune, vol, pan, cutoff, resonance, left offset, right offset, both offset)
        - waveform (sine, square, saw, triangle, random)
        - rate
        - depth
-lfo 2 - assignment (off, finetune, tune, vol, pan, cutoff, resonance, , left offset, right offset, both offset, lfo 1
depth, lfo 1 rate, etc...)
        - waveform (sine, square, saw, triangle, random)
        - rate
        - depth
-lfo 3 - assignment (off, finetune, tune, vol, pan, cutoff, resonance, , left offset, right offset, both offset, lfo 1
depth, lfo 1 rate, etc...)
        - waveform (sine, square, saw, triangle, random)
        - rate
        - depth
-lfo 4 - assignment (off, finetune, tune, vol, pan, cutoff, resonance, , left offset, right offset, both offset, lfo 1
depth, lfo 1 rate, etc...)
        - waveform (sine, square, saw, triangle, random)
        - rate
        - depth
-volume envelope data
-panning envelope data
-pitch envelope data
-filter envelope data
-number of velocity splits (1-16)
-number of samples (0-255)

-velocity split data [0->number of splits, stored incrementally from lowest
split to highest]
-sample header data [0->number of samples]
-sample data [0->number of samples]

================================

Envelope data

-number of points (0 if no envelope)
-loop point
-loop to point
-loop mode (off, repeat, sustain) - points can loop to selves, sustain point
stops looping on noteoff
-loop type (forward, reverse, pingpong)
-point data [0->number of points], must be stored sorted by time, first
point must be at time 0

================================

Envelope Point data
-amplitude
-time

================================

Velocity split - global params across velocity split
-volume (applied across entire split to compensate for velocity)
-max velocity (for this split)
-sample keymap (array from c-0 to b-9 of sample indexes)

================================

Sample Header data
-volume
-panning
-tune
-finetune
-number of beats in sample
-left offset (into sample, msec)
-right offset (into sample, msec)
-stretch bpm for sample
-stretch sample duration (msec)
-duration stretch mode - (none, use stretch bpm and # beats, use song sync
and # beats,  use stretch sample duration value, use original sample rate) -
this is for loops, works like acid, requires a pitch shifter for most modes
-pitch shift mode - (off, pitch algorithm selections) (only used if duration
stretch mode is on)
-sample loop start
-sample loop end
-loop mode (off, repeat, sustain) - points can loop to selves, sustain point
stops looping on noteoff
-loop type (forward, reverse, pingpong)

===================================

Sample Data
just use WAV format
