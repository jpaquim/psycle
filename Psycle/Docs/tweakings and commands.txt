- Controlling/Tweaking Generators and Effects
---------------------------------------------

	Tweaking a machine from the pattern is changing the value of its knobs to
	another one.
	This way, you can control the machine in realtime (playback).

	To do so, you use the TWEAK command. You see it like "twk" in the note Row.


- How to insert the TWEAK command in the Pattern
------------------------------------------------

	If the following is a pattern Row,
           
	Description:   (1) (2)(3) (4)
	Pattern Row : ---- .. .. ....

	then, on (1) , you insert the TWEAK command. To do so, you should press the TWK key.
	When doing so, the word "twk" will appear.

	\\\	The twk key differs from different keyboard languages, but you can Configure
	///	it in the Keyboard Settings DialogBox (Configuration-Keyboard Configuration)

	 
	On (2) , you define the Controller/Parameter you want to change. Later in this
 	document it is explained how you can know this number.

	On (3) , you specify the number of the Machine, just like you do to enter notes.
	To know the Number of an Effect, you need to change the Combobox that says
	"Generators", to "Effects". Then, the Generators' list will be updated with
	the Effects Machines.

	Finally, on (4), you specify the Value that the parameter will take. There are
	little differences in tweaking an Native Plugin and a VST plugin. Look further on
	this document to know them.

	Example:

		twk 05 42 0067  05 Indicates Parameter 05
				42 Indicates Effect Number 2
				0067 Indicates the value



- Knowing the Parameter number of a Machine
-------------------------------------------

	You have different ways to know the parameter number of one plugin.

	* The easiest one is selecting "Params" in the "MIDI/Params/Waves", combobox.
	  This way, the next combobox will be updated with the parameter list of the current
	  selected machine.
	  The number will automatically be added to the pattern when doing twk.

	You could also know it by:
	* With Native Machines:
	  Opening the parameters' windows and right clicking over the parameter you want to
	  change.This will pop up the "Tweaking" dialog.
	  On the titlebar of this dialog, you will see a number in HEX. This is the number
	  of the parameter.

	* With VST plugins:
	  Opening the parameters' window, you can see a list of the parameters on the
	  right side. These parameters are numbered in HEX.
	  This is the number you need.


- Knowing the Right Value
-------------------------

	There are differences between VST plugins, Psycle plugins and internal plugins:

	* VST Plugins:
	  They have a fixed range. 0 is the smallest value, and FFFF is the biggest.

	* Psycle Native Plugins:
	  They have a range defined by the knob's value. You need to move the knob to the
	  desired position and right click over the parameter to open the "Tweaking" dialog.
	  Then, the value of that knob in that position will be shown.
	__Remember that you have to convert the given value to an hex value__

	  Advise: If the knob's minimum value is not zero (Like, with the VCF Envmod), 
	  0 = min value

	* Psycle Internal machines: (The Mess)
	  They usually have values between 0 and 128 (or 0 and 256).
	  __Remember that you have to convert the given value to an hex value__
	  
	  To indicate a negative value, (for example, for the feedback) you can add 8000
	  Example: 8004 means -4



- Mcm Command. Use MIDI CC's to control VST Plugins
-----------------------------------------------

	The Mcm command works in a similar way than the Twk Command:

	If the following is a pattern Row,
           
	Description:   (1) (2)(3) (4)
	Pattern Row : ---- .. .. ....

	then, on (1) , you insert the Mcm command.
	To do so, you should press SHIFT + TWK key. Of course, you can change this key to
	another one in the Keyboard Configuation Dialog.

	On (2) , you define the CC (Command number) that you want to send.
	You might need to check some MIDI documents and/or the Plugin's help to know what
	to write in here.

	On (3) , you specify the number of the Machine, just like you do to enter notes.
	To know the Number of an Effect, you need to change the Combobox that says
	"Generators", to "Effects". Then, the Generators' list will be updated with
	the Effects Machines.

	Finally, on (4), you specify the Value that the parameter will take.
	
	(4) is divided in two groups of two values AABB.
	You might only need to speficy AA.

	Example: Send NoteOn:

		Mcm 90 01 3C7F  90 Means NoteOn (9) on Midi Channel 1 (0).
				01 Means Generator number 1
				3C Means C-5 (3C in Hex = 60 in Dec)
				7F Means the Velocity (volume) of the note.

- Pattern Commands
------------------

	Psycle also allows to use some "old school" commands in the command row.
	The currently supported ones are:


	* Global/Tracker Commands: 

	  FFxx	-	Change BPM
	  FExx	-	Change Tick Per Beat
	  FDxx  -	Delay Trigger (xx/256 ticks) (works with noteoffs too)
	  FCxx	-	Change Global/Wire Volume
			Examples:
			--- .. .. FC80	Sets Global Volume to the half.
			--- 01 05 FC40	Sets Wire 1 of GENERATOR 5 to volume 40 (1/4th)
			--- 01 45 FC30	Sets Wire 1 of EFFECT 5 to volume 30.

			Aux column indicates the wire number.
			It is shown in the _title_ of the wire Dialog.
	  

	  FBxx	-	Retrigger (xx/256 ticks duration per trigger)
	  FAxy  -	Retrigger Continue (x/16 = ticks duration per trigger, 
				0 = use current) (y = acceleration, 1-8 pos, 9-f negative
				f is the slowest negative acceleration, 1 is slowest 
				positive acceleration) * does not trigger on new line, rather
				continues from previous retrigger position
	  F8xx	-	Sets the indicated Machine's Panning
			Example:
			--- .. 05 F880 Sets the panning of Generator 5 to 80 (Middle)

	* VST Commands:

	  0Cxx	-	Set volume (only works on NoteOn!)

	  10xx	-	_OLD_ MIDI Command. Not documented anymore. Use the "Mcm" command.

	  (More to come, someday)


	* Sampler Commands:

	  01xx	-	Portamento Up
	  02xx	-	Portamento Down
	  08xx	-	Set panning position
	  09xx	-	Set sampler offset
	  0Cxx	-	Set volume
	  0ECx	-	Note cut in x frames
	  0EDx	-	Note delay in x frames
	  15xy	-	Retrig Command. y = Number of retrigs (1 = do one retrig)
			-	x changes the volume in the following way:
				0 or 8 : No change
				1: +1		9:  -1
				2: +2		A: -2
				3: +4		B: -4
				4: +8		C: -8
				5: +16		D: -16
				6: *2/3		E: *3/2
				7: *1/2		F: *2
	

	* Argury Synth 2f ( Also other (old) Arguru Synths) :

	  01xx	-	Pitch slide-up
	  02xx	-	Pitch slide-down
	  03xx	-	Pitch glide
	  04xx	-	Vibrato [x=depth, y=speed]
	  07xx	-	Change VCF ENV modulation [00=-128,FF=128]
	  08xx	-	Change VCF Cutoff frequency
	  09xx	-	Change VCF Resonance amount
	  0Exx	-	Note Cut in x frames (Only AS2.xx)
	  11xx	-	VCF Cutoff slide-up
	  12xx	-	VCF Cutoff slide-down

	* JMDrum Synth:

	  0Cxx	-	Set volume
