** <alk_> when Psycle is open hibernate does not work (windows crashes)

* Machines
------------
***	alk - gap in audio when add new machine.
		[ It is caused because the method closes the output to avoid thread conflicts.
		Should be using the semaphore of the Player class.]
**	<_sue_> the gainer machine doesnt work
		[ getting stuck bug i have been able to recreate once but not debug-when i recreated it,
		song was fucking up bad due to not enough buffers (and too small)]
**	Flanger clicks : 
		[ http://psycle.pastnotecut.org/thread.php?threadid=626&boardid=2&styleid=1 ]
**	cyanphase vibrasynth has an access violation bug
		[ I need source to fix]
**	JAL7OH- JMdrum.dll crashes psycle (or gets muted) when using FBxx and/or FAxx.
**	JMDrum is buggy (Crashes after changing settings sometimes)
*	<_sue_> are there any bugless ported machines? m3 in 22050 mode just makes a click..nothing more....
*	bohan - knowledge: bug arguru_distortion saturator line 92 missing brackets.
		[[JAZ] : I believe It's not needed.]
!	James says: i noticed that the appegiator in the lab causes constant retriggering of VCA
++	<[JAZ]> Internals still miss mouse tweak, right?
+	<alk_> make the master dialog an adaptation of the wire dialog, same but with a slider for each input
+	<pooplog> it would be nice to have an internal wavein machine to get live input
		<Druttis> Yes
		<trylle> i mean that it records and plays back at the same time * record wave in too

* Sampler Machine:
--------------------------
FF ******************* NEW SAMPLER NEEDS TO BE CODED ***********************
*	Sample loop not works - is it possible to fix it in next Psycle release?
		[[JAZ] Works for me.]
*	portamento to note, slides too much.
		[[JAZ] can anyone test this for me?]
+FF	just have an checkbox to enable or disable the Amplitude, or the whole synthesis (phongshade)
+FF	Instruments Support ( *.xi , *.iti, *.sf2. Maybe more)
		 * samples mapped by key
		 * maybe: samples mapped by velocity?
+	Improve Filter support.
		 * twk Control
		 * maybe: allow filter cutoff/res mapping to velocity
+	volume slides/arpeggio
+	better way to set loop points. (+ ping-pong loops)

* Wave Editor:
--------------------------
+++ <_sue_> prolly some already sugested this but, a play button in the wave editor is really needed
		[Problem: Needs a sampler Machine. The wave preview is not adecuated]
		[<pooplog> Could preview just like the load dialog does...]
+	ALK waveed: remove silence from start and end of wave
+	Mystic - import .mp3 format for samples
+	Easier way to load Samples.
+	Toolbar for the Wave Editor.

* GUI (pattern):
----------------
***	<alk> block select a channel. record some tweak to it live.
		before the end of the pattern press stop. then do ctrl-x. It does not cut.
		[cannot reproduce]
**	<alk> somehow I managed to get the row number highlighted in two places.
		to cause the bug of more than one line number highlighted:
		select a line, then lower down click and drag to select a block.
		cause the window to scroll by making the block go off the Bottom of the screen.
		(notice the previous highlight moving up) now click another place. 
		[cannot reproduce]
**	Can't select with keyboard while follow song on, and playing.
		[[JAZ] We Need to differenciate what's follow song, and what's record notes to pattern]
++	<wayfinder> and yet another thing: when i enter notes with shift, i progress not down a row, but to 
		the next column. so far, so cool (another IT feature :D) but when i let go of the shift key, the 
		cursor stays in the last column i made a note in - wouldnt it be cooler if it jumped back to the 
		next row in my start column?
++	velocity should be able to store data to instrument column. So should other midi messages
+	how about option to switch the instrument and machine columns?
+	option to see waveform instead of notes in pattern editor for acid mode
+	D says: maybe have some of the effects in a drop down or available by right clicking
+	D says: When you highlight something in Psycle would it be possible to make it so you can drag and 
		drop that highlighted area?
+	Xerox replace, allow multiple - it replaces the selected pattern(s) with an identical new one
+	Xerox multiple
+	In FT2, the cursor Jumps to the top of a pattern when you move from one to another (Kris)
+	maybe: MultiPattern View (see the previous pattern at top and the next at bottom, like if it was continuous)


* GUI (machines):
-----------------
*** preview check box in preset dialog stopped working? 
	[ it works, but you can't test notes realtime because the dialog is modal ]
**	alk:  note gets stuck bug, open a machine dialog, play a note, move the machine window,
		before releasing mouse button release note, then release mouse.
		[Could it be InputHandler::KeyToCmd() not understanding the key because of the mouse button?]
* alk - when opening master dialog [doesn't] centre on mouse?
	[ he refers to the X coordinate not centered i believe ]
* moving machines makes playback pop - machine interface takes too long to redraw, and moving causes redraw
	on every frame - make bigger buffers and more of them to prevent this from happening
* <bdzld> when you put a machine on top of each other, the vus always pop to the top?
* <alk> move mouse over vu, black flickering (more noticable on the big vus)* transparent only i think
* <alk> in felix.psy can't connect attack generator to the compressor effect (machine connect failed) 
	[ this file has been corrupted somehow, how/when was it saved? ]
	[ it was saved in march or april in and old version, most likely bugged alpha ]
!!	machine param enter dialog should be modeless.
		[[JAZ] Why? What do you want to do meanwhile?]
		[<pooplog> play notes to test parameter]
!?	alk - make wires square ended, like spec analyser
+++	Replace Machine by another (right click menu? new button?).
		[ GEAR RACK DIALOG WILL DO THIS ]
+++	 <_sue_> and also being able to select the slot in wich you load a generator.....it goes by defaul to 
		the first not used....sometimes i wanna switch generators and the new one goes to the wrong slot....
		[ GEAR RACK DIALOG WILL DO THIS ]
+++ Saving all the missing settings to registry (like class of plugin..)
++	<_sue_> (wire dialog) also i cant use the keyb to set the db level like before (cursor keys)
		[pooplog-we should just make a new slider class that uses shift and ctrl like knobs for this]
+ Prevent duplicate names when creating Machines ( FeedMe , FeedMe 2...)
+ Directories in "Add new machine" (Sorting with directories)
		 Remember previous used and add "class/type" selection to registry
+ Prevent duplicate names when creating Machines ( FeedMe , FeedMe 2...)
+ Internal Fx Gui to Native Gui Conversion (including wiredialog, or not...)
		 Create a new "universal" MachineFrame class, for all plugins
		 (Needs a few more changes in the class definitions)
+	VST/Native machine Windows : ESC = close (Problem: can't close within the CWnd!!!)
+	Option to hide Parameters in VST GUI.
+	Add Presets in a "tab" under Parameters (easy switching/testing)!
+	<_sue_> native mahcines gui should have sliders...it would change a lot....
		<pooplog> sliders, switches, and owner draw controls i say?
+	James says: how hard would it be to put nodes in the wires, so you can bend them?
+?	<alk> make single click/drag move wire from one machine to another (preserving vol) 
		[ This means changing the destination ]

* Player Engine:
----------------
***	Midiout is NOT solid...
**	<Alk^> do u think the recording with subtracting the buffer delay will be doable? - use fdxx command 
**	<sue> playbar should take latency into account - same as ^
**	song speed alters if i alter sampling rate while playing.
		[Configuration does not notify plugins of samplingrate change.]
**	<_sue_> (autostop) now it also behaves weird with internal delays even if not in record mode....just 
		playng
		[Might be fixed already, if the problem was that machines remained muted]
*	When changing octave, notes playing should be stopped (because if not, notes playing don't stop)
		[Problem!!! All key processing is done by InputHandler, so machines don't know when it happens,
		 and neither does Inputhandler know which machines are playing.
		 Doing a "player::Stop()" would be a bit hardcore.
		 I agree]
*FF	plugins which make use of the "SaveData" (native) or "SaveChunk" (VST’) can cause a crash if they are
		missing when you load a song. Won’t get fixed by now. Needs a fileformat change.
!!!FF	longer sequences (256)
!!!FF	more tracks (64)
+++	Finish SAVE as wave, have options for: sample rate, # channels, bitsize
+++FF?	DirectX effects, intstruments
+++	option for record to take command FD into account like ft2
+++FF	new file format: (machines save custom data length, patterns stored according to # tracks, sequence 
		length stored according to length, vst multi-out, connections as linked lists, wire nodes, 
		volume column, multiout info, etc.)
++	ALK tracker command to bypass an fx, mute command for machines
		[Currently machines are disconnected when doing so. If we do the commands, they should be just muted]
++	Maybe: New command "twc" which will send a machine command (like note delay, to say a silly one)
		 to the machine indicated by gen, and ___>to_the_channel_indicated_by_"inst"<____!
		 (asked by Pikari)
++	tws (Tweak Slide) Command to slide the tweak. (asked by _sue_)
+	pattern repeat (loop) and song repeat (asked by Vir|us)
+FF	<pooplog> again i ask why the connection limit is 12 and not 16 or 24
		[should use linked lists instead of arrays]

* Vsts:
------------
***	Crash bug when loading a big .fxb file, problem with deleting, etc...  (Rep. by Vibra and JAL7OH-)
		[Fix:Basically, make ONLY .fxb for VST's.]
*	JAL7OH- patches in the preset editor should not be sorted by name - most banks (fxb) are already
		sorted by the authors.
		[ A "bypass" bug, if we do the above ^]
*	<_sue_> theres also a strange bug in psycle that it increases/changes param 00 of the vst plug 
		depending on the place where theyr box was placed...
		[also not able to recreate]
*	JAL7OH- vsampler3 vsti doesnt draw its popups and undocked windows properly
		 (im experiencing the same problems with all previous releases alpha1,2 and beta1,2 of vsampler)
*	JAL7OH- reaktor 3.05 - psy crashes on exiting when reaktor is loaded;
		docked toolbars in reaktor are invisible when running as a vst plug in psycle so to become visible
		again i had to run reaktor in buzz (where they are visible) undock them and then run reaktorvst in psycle;
	psycle crashes when i get the 'cpu overload' warning in reaktor
*	<_sue_> but with native intruments pro-52 it doesnt rec the tweaks at all.....
		<pooplog> are you able to control the tweaks of it from the pattern?
		<_sue_> yes i am (in pro52)
		[ How does those plugins do Automation then? Maybe it is a Host fault not reporting that it supports it? ]
*	New Note in Quadrasid does not reinitialize the Envelope.
		[ Bug? This doesn't happen on freebase]
*	many vsts freeze the childview from updating while Left mouse button is down, which makes it so pattern does
		not draw, so it appears that tweak recording is not working, such as:
		-juno X2
		-externalizer
		-leveler
		-tools one
+++FF	<bdzld> which is support for multiout vsti?
		<pooplog> if psycle was smart enough to detect mutli-out vst, when you drag a wire to it, it could pop up a 			
		dialog asking what you ouput want it to connect to - this will require a file format change though :(
!	List of "VST's not to load".

* Interface (contains pattern stuff too):
------------
***	<alk> after I leave a song open for some time, I try and do save and it says "error creating file"
		[_fileName doesn't store the SongDir, and it gets reseted after closing the config dialog.
		Fix: add directory to filename and remove it for titlebar and load/save dialogs]
		[ -> config dialog only changes SongDir if user changes it in the dialog ]
*** new machine dialog should save preferred sorting method
** <Erodix> theres one little thing.. when psycle is playing and i double-click an song, a new 
	psycle opens..
** <lipid> so is there any way to make 'Delete' an assignable key in the keyboard config? * some other key 
	combinations don't work either, like ctrl+pageup etc.
** <[JAZ]> "fixing" the cache.map file so that it can include dates of dll's and update automatically 
	the info when new one.
** should save wire dialog settings
*??	why does it take so long to load a song?
* <alk> in the master the vols dont match up with the wire vol, seems to be 0.1 bigger
*	<alk> there's a bug where when u alt-tab the icon is not correct 
		[ cannot find the reason, older version had this too ]
* Instrument filter envelope slider. (check differences with finetune slider)
!!!	Psycle default colours should be improved (cursor, selection, etc.)
!!	<_sue_> hi...... all those loading/exit/save confirmations are anoying me a bit.....any chance to make 
		them optional in the configs menu? when i start psycle and load a track it even asks me if i want to 
		save the old psy (wich i havent even changed)
		<pooplog> so should the song info popup
!!	Should make it so clicking on colour boxes pops up menu
!!	<angelus>What about an option to select the visibility of this pattern-sequence menu. You can hide or 
		show it when you want.
!!	<pooplog> i mean follow song, multi aud, noteoffs, tweaks, etc. could be buttons perhaps
!	JAL7OH- the cycle lenght in the swing fill dialog set to lines per beat/2 by default
+++ 	<[JAZ]> gear rack The description was : " a dialog with 
		a list of machines (from 00: to 7F, that is, Gens and Fx), and buttons of : Add new, remove, swap, 
		exchange, and don't know if anything more... maybe some information (wires used... don't know)
++	<alk> another idea, a keypress to toggle follow song
++	<alk_> alt-f5 - play song from start
++	<alk_> another thought: "revert to saved" - filemenu
		[Isn't it the same as Load?]
++	<wayfinder> alk, i'm also missing keys for soloing channels(in IT it's alt-F10 for solo) 
++ midi control commands learn
++	<[JAZ]> pooplog : Mmmmm... Seems that the "song modified" code doesn't work now.. 
		[because machine view does not track changes yet]
++	<_sue_> something like selecting a generator and having some global edit functions (in the edit menu :)  
		like :  delete all notes / tranpose all + 12 / delete all tweaks .....stuff like this *for the entire song*
++FF	songs should save master decrease flag
		[This can be hacked by now without need of fileformat change]
++ <sue> hotkeys for seq edit cut, copy, paste, etc?
++	<doktor1> "how can i make all paterns 128 lenght , not by modifing 1 by 1" 
		[ we should store a default pattern length parameter]
+ <Alk> to be able to drop a play markers (start and end) to loop through to make editing easier
+ <Alk> +alt to make the transposing only effect current machine/sample
		i.e. ctrl+alt+f11 = transpose current gen/sample down 1 note
		ctrl+alt+shift+f12 = transpose current gen/sample up 1 octave
+	<dp|away> you could setup some standard buffers you know are solid and do like setting low -> high 
		and shield the user from the nastiness
+	James says: i have an idea for that actually... seeing as there are so many configurable 
		keys... could perhaps have a textbox, where if you clicked in there, typed a key, it would highlight 
		what was assigned to it
+	<alk_> the 'Apply' button is not implemented in the config dialog
+	<alk> make it so that you can click anywhere on the wire to get wire vol? (in case triangle is hidden)
+	<alk> song properties (allow carriage returns, make box bigger?)
+	<_sue_> centering the open file menus....
		and saving theyre size.......i allways have to make them larger so i can browse my samples dir....its 
		convenient for when you have folders with many files as you usually do with samples
+	<Alk^> I also think that the cursor movement after a paste should be optional to =)
+	<_sue_> hey poop....can we have something like a right double click for inserting the first not used 
		pattern (like instert button)?
			[Isn't this what "New" is for?]
+	<sue> <pooplog> so please explain to me exactly what sequence mix paste button would do- it would mix-paste data 
		into the currently selected blocks? <sue> yes it would work as pattern mix paste for more than one pattern.
+	<wayfinder> alk, oh oh and another one :D it would be cool if you could, for example with alt-0 through 
		9, change the row skip
+	<wayfinder> alk, and it would be nice if the row skip would affect the cursor movement as well (or at 
		least if the tracker could be configured to do so=)
+	<wayfinder> like navigating in the sequence list with the cursor
		[No. It is not needed, and causes alot of harm. if you want to navigate you have hotkeys]
+	<wayfinder> numeric entering of pattern number
+	<wayfinder> oh, i forgot one function of the IT pattern editor. when the cursor isnt following the 
		pattern, or when the song isnt playing, hitting the G key on a number takes you to that pattern
		[ dear wayfinder, please remember that this is not IT damnit ]
+?	<wayfinder> it would be so much cooler if there were like macros
		say, i have a chorus part that's pattern 4, 6, 4, 5 and i have that three times in the song or so
		i'd love to define pattern macro A as "4, 6, 4, 5" and be able to enter macro A in the 
		pattern sequencer
+	 MORE Keyboard shortcuts
		[ We've added some more actually]

* Driver Issues:
------------
*	Output gets weird after a bit and start playing all crackly and doubletime
		[<[JAZ]> I've seen this bug only when playing a song, going to configure the output and accepting
		in the "waveout" or "Directsound" box. When accepting in the config dialog, all is back to normal.]
*	DirectSound Output is a bit buggy.Crashes and bad sound reported. 
*	MIDI only works with Waveout

* Importing:
------------
*	It doesn't add the machines necessary to play all notes.
*FF	if you import an XM file and save, the finetune of the samples is not saved (Fileformat limitation)
+	Add option for the user to create samplers for instruments
+	IT importing
+	.mid import
+	Import machines from song - the (regular) .psy is loaded without erasing the already loaded song ignoring 
		pattern data and other settings, this possible? (yes, but will require new song parser...)










-- Possible Features For Psycle 2 --
------------------------------------

* Editing Capabilities:
-----------------------
	* Multi pattern Sequencing
	* Multiple Editors (Not only tracker view)
	* Parameter Automation  ( Envelopes for Parameters )
	* Velocity/Panning/other_weird column to pattern data
	* Appregiator: One "template" note, notes "produced" by the appregiator in a different colour.
	* "zip"-able columns.
	* Tracker track? (for bpm, global volume...)
	? Notes of current selected machine marked with a different colour
	? Maybe notes/etc, of muted machines shown in grey
	? Time signatures

* Machines :
------------

	* Multiple Inputs/Outputs
	* MIDI generator - instead of generating audio, generates MIDI out - sync could be an issue.
	* Sequencers: Posibility to control more than one machine at the same time
	* Compressor/limiter
	* Flanger/Chorus

* Audio/Control:
----------------

	* ASIO driver I/O
	* audio record support (Like, from microphone)
	* "MIDI Controlling <-> Machine <-> Machine" Interface = MIDI mapping
	  (allow to map midi commands to change different parameters)

	* Ogg/Winamp Plugin export?
