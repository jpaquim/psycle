! remove waits from play when in export mode
! should be able to pick cursor colour rather than have it invert background 
! lines between tracks should be definable, not black
+ midi control commands learn
! longer sequences (256) [file format,maybe others]
! more tracks (64) [file format]
+ store state of follow song toggle
+ Import machines from song - the (regular) .psy is loaded without erasing the already loaded song ignoring 
	pattern data and other settings, this possible? (yes, but will require new song parser...)
! should make it so clicking on colour boxes pops up menu
* screen flashes switching from machine to pattern view (new)
* dragging machines is not always the greatest pleasure of all. *** the other day it was being weird but today 
	it is fine.  i think it has to do with cpu load.
* pattern view does not refresh when skin dlg presets have changed.
+ actual skinning
* song length calculation does not take ffxx/fexx commands into account
+ visual preset saving/loading
! DO NOT LOAD LIST VST list & database
! <angelus>What about an option to select the visibility of this pattern-sequence menu. You can hide or show it 
	when you want.
+ <doktor1> "how can i make all paterns 128 lenght , not by modifing 1 by 1" -> we should store a default 
	pattern length parameter
* <Alk^> do u think the recording with subtracting the buffer delay will be doable? 
+ <Alk^> I think the line numbering should be optional
+ <Alk^> I also think that the cursor movement after a paste should be optional to =)
* Alk* place cursor on last line, change to machine screen and back to pattern, bug
+ Alk* would be useful to put dialogs like wire vol into separate tasks (modeless) so psycle is not disabled 
	when they are open
! <pooplog> i mean follow song, multi aud, noteoffs, tweaks, etc. could be buttons perhaps
+ <_sue_> hey poop....can we have something like a right double click for inserting the first not used pattern
	 (like instert button)?
! <_sue_> the pattern sequencer "mini" window could really be longer.....depending on windows screen res....in 
	the one im using i have half of the tab where the pattern seq is completely free.
+ <_sue_> something like selecting a generator and having some global edit functions (in the edit menu :)  
	like :  delete all notes / tranpose all + 12 / delete all tweaks .....stuff like this -> for the entire song
! <_sue_> and also being able to select the slot in wich you load a generator.....it goes by defaul to the first 
	not used....sometimes i wanna switch generators and the new one goes to the wrong slot....
+ <sue> <pooplog> so please explain to me exactly what sequence mix paste button would do- it would mix-paste data 
	into the currently selected blocks? <sue> yes it would work as pattern mix paste for more than one pattern.
+ <sue> hotkeys for seq edit cut, copy, paste, etc?
* <sue> when pressing enter on a generator tweak, the generator number is captured, but that doesnt happen if  
	you press enter on an effect tweak. <_sue_> the first point in my txt is not true.....enter captures 
	native fx tweaks.....and even vsts fx tweaks.....but it doesnt shows it in the pull down menu (only in vsts)
* <sue> when selecting vsts the midi/params/waves pull down menu should go automaticly to "params" (this already 
	happens to native plugs)
+ <sue>in the plugs gui: control + left mouse button on a knob to capture respective param in the pulldown menu 
	(many vsts use control + left mouse button to reset knobs/params....maybe any other alike key 
	combination.... )
* <bdzld> when you're in pattern edit and you maximise the window it blacks out -> sizing down too
+ <bdzld> which is support for multiout vsti? <pooplog> if psycle was smart enough to detect mutli-out vst, when 
	you drag a wire to it, it could pop up a dialog asking what you ouput want it to connect to - this will 
	require a file format change though :(
* <bdzld> when you put a machine on top of each other, the vus always pop to the top?
+ pooplog - dragging files onto psycle window would be nice, hmm?
* switched a pattern length to 2 and the empty space was not cleared, it looped 0 1 0 1 0 1
* trying to select past the visible area with the mouse sucks
* preview check box in preset dialog stopped working?
* did some transpose selection and display got fucking crazy i was very confused - undo did same.
* moving machines makes playback pop
* waveoutMME gets weird after a bit and start playing all crackly and doubletime
* psycle crashed after changing waveout/directx settings around
+ songs should save master decrease flag
+ What if master machine looked like a mixer and you could double click it to bring up not only the master volume,
	but labelled volume sliders for each of the machines connected to it? -> this would suck as you would get names
	for only the effects
+ how about nice looking bmp windows for machine link and master machine dialogs?
+ how about option to switch the instrument and machine columns?
* record button should set edit mode and follow mode on, should have new export wav button
+ global note delay effects command
* <_sue_> vst tweak rec still stalls...its like it stops follow song... it happens with reFX junox2 it stalls 
	but it recs the tweaks......it just doesnt refresh or something.... with refx junox2 it only shows the 
	rec tweaks when you do a refresh.......like closing the plugs  gui...
* <_sue_> but with native intruments pro-52 it doesnt rec the tweaks at all..... <pooplog> are you able to 
	control 	the tweaks of it from the pattern? <_sue_> yes i am (in pro52)
+ ALK You may have coinsidered this already, making machines have a right click menu (from the 
	machines view) with one of the items benig duplicate machine.
* <Erodix> theres one little thing.. when psycle is playing and i double-click an song, a new 
	psycle opens..
+ ALK tracker command to bypass an fx, mute command for machines
+ ALK waveed: remove silence from start and end of wave
* keyboard notes/noteoffs do not always seem to record


	*Flanger feedback slider
	 Instrument filter envelope slider. (check differences with finetune slider)

	*changing octave, make notes stop (because if not, notes playing don't stop)



-- Psycle 1.67
--------------

* Sampler Machine/Wave Ed:
--------------------------
	bug: 	 portamento to note slides too much. (can anyone test this for me?)
	feature: just have an checkbox to enable or disable the Amplitude, or the whole synthesis (phongshade)
	feature: Instruments Support ( *.xi , *.iti, *.sf2. Maybe more)
		 * samples mapped by key
		 * maybe: samples mapped by velocity?
	feature: Improve Filter support.
		 * twk Control
		 * maybe: allow filter cutoff/res mapping to velocity
	feature: volume slides/arpeggio
	feature: better way to set loop points. (+ ping-pong loops)
	feature: Easier way to load Samples.
	feature: Toolbar for the Wave Editor.
	feature: Note playback in WaveEd (Problem: Needs a sampler Machine. The wave preview is not adecuated)

* GUI (pattern):
----------------
	bug:	 Select with mouse when playing gives problems
	feature: FT2 Jumps to the top of a pattern when you move from one to another (Kris)
	feature: maybe: MultiPattern View (The code is not made in the best way)
	feature: MORE Keyboard shortcuts 
	feature: tws (Tweak Slide) Command to slide the tweak. (asked by _sue_)
	feature: First, I'd like to see the Generator or Effect name in one of these places
		 when I hover over a note in the Pattern Editor ( MrToast )

* GUI (machines):
-----------------
	feature: Saving all the missing settings to registry (like follow song, class of plugin..)
	feature: Clone Machine Button
	feature: Replace Machine by another.
	feature: Prevent duplicate names when creating Machines ( FeedMe , FeedMe 2...)
	feature: Directories in "Add new machine" (Sorting with directories)
		 Remember previous used and add "class/type" selection to registry
	feature: Internal Fx Gui to Native Gui Conversion (including wiredialog)
		 Create a new "universal" MachineFrame class, for all plugins
		 (Needs a few more changes in the class definitions)
	feature: VST/Native machine Windows : ESC = close (Problem: can't close within the CWnd!!!)
	feature: Option to hide Parameters in VST GUI.
	feature: Add Presets in a "tab" under Parameters (easy switching/testing)!
	bug:     Crash bug when loading a big .fxb file, problem with deleting, etc...  (Rep. by Vibra)
		 Fix:Basically, make ONLY .fxb for VST's.
	feature: Really good looking new Master Machine.(Graphics under res\MasterMachine)
	bug:	 JMDrum is buggy (Crashes sometimes)


* Player Engine:
----------------
	bug:	 In some rare cases, when opening a song, psycle produces noise. (See "fly to the moon [non vocal].psy")
		 When opening it, a noise is produced by one machine and passed to the others. The bug doesn't happen
		 when debugging!
	bug:	 "MidiInput.cpp(359): warning #68: integer conversion resulted in a change of sign"
	bug:	 plugins which make use of the "SaveData" (native) or "SaveChunk" (VST’) can cause a crash if they are
		 missing when you load a song. Won’t get fixed by now. Needs a fileformat change.
	bug:	 New Note in Quadrasid does not reinitialize the Envelope. (Bug? This doesn't happen on freebase)
	bug:	 DirectSound Output is a bit buggy.Crashes and bad sound reported. 
	feature: Maybe: New command "twc" which will send a machine command (like note delay, to say a silly one)
		 to the machine indicated by gen, and ___>to_the_channel_indicated_by_"inst"<____!
		 (asked by Pikari)
	feature: pattern repeat (loop) and song repeat (asked by Vir|us)
	feature: Note Delay to VST's
