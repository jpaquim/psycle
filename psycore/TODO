# This is a sorted list, top priority at the top!

*	Source files that don't build because they are work-in-progress.
	Symptom: build failure.
	Since the build systems (both scons and the autotools) want
	to build all *.cpp files found under the src dir, don't forget
	to disable the unfinished sources with something like:
	#if defined XPSYCLE__EXPERIMENTAL
		... something that's quite not yet right ...
	#endif
	Alternatively, it's possible to put them in a subdir named "todo": dirs with
	that name are excluded when searching for *.cpp files (also leading dot like .foo.cpp)

###############################

====================
Editing Capabilities
====================

	* Multi pattern Sequencing
	* Multiple Editors (Not only tracker view)
	* Parameter Automation  ( Envelopes for Parameters )
	* Velocity/Panning/other_weird column to pattern data
	* Appregiator: One "template" note, notes "produced" by the appregiator in a different colour.
	* "zip"-able columns.
	* Global track? (for bpm, global volume...)
	? Notes of current selected machine marked with a different colour
	? Maybe notes/etc, of muted machines shown in grey
	? Time signatures

========
Machines
========

	* Multiple Inputs/Outputs
	* MIDI generator - instead of generating audio, generates MIDI out - sync could be an issue.
	* Sequencers: Posibility to control more than one machine at the same time
	* Compressor/limiter
	* Flanger/Chorus

=============
Audio/Control
=============

	* audio record support (Like, from microphone)
	* "MIDI Controlling <-> Machine <-> Machine" Interface = MIDI mapping
	  (allow to map midi commands to change different parameters)

	* Ogg/Winamp Plugin export?
