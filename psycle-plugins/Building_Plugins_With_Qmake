 The plugins can be built with qmake by entering into the qmake folder and executing the following command:

qmake qmakeBuildPlugins

the plugins will be built in ++build in the psycle-plugins directory.  Note that qmake and make must be
in your path for this to work, the script to build all plugins is not using qmake properly, but just
using it to execute commands.

Single plugins can be built with

qmake $plugin_name.pro  
make

and will be built in the same location.

FluidSynth and Y_MIDI are not built with qmake as they are not cross-platform.
