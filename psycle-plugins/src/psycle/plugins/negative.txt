bdzld's negative v1.1
---------------------

This is a clone of the cheapo plugin in buzz - it multiplies all values
by -1, inverting the signal allowing you to do interesting things with them ;)

Apo's site is here - http://www.hut.fi/~mapo/, make sure you check it out, he's a talented producer and coder.

have fun!
