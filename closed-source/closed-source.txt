Because we have no control over the plugins in the closed-source directory,
we cannot garantee that they work best, or even correctly, for every CPU architecture.

The plugins in this directory are grouped by authors.

If you encounter any problem with pooplog's or druttis's plugins, you will probably have not much difficulties in reporting it to their author and get a fix.

But for other plugins, we have not much contact with their authors, and we don't know wether they would still maintain their software, or they don't care anymore or have lost the sources.

we now have the sources of druttis' plugins :-)
As soon as we are sure we can compile them correctly, we'll remove the .dll from here.
