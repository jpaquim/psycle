A quick doc on skinning psycle
------------------------------

1) Preface, What's skinnable?

	There are two things skinnable right now, the Machine boxes, and the Pattern headers.
	At a later time we will probably allow skinning of knobs (native machines' parameters)

	These parts support different sizes and also transparency.

2) What do I need in order to skin?

	You need to make four files, two for graphics, and two for image information.
	These files are the folowing:

		your_machine_graphics_name.bmp
		your_header_graphics_name.bmp
		your_machine_graphics_info_.psm
		your_header_graphics_info.psh

	You can put them in subdirectories if you like, but they have NOT to contain dots "."
	(this limitation might be removed at a later time).

	Also, note that the .psm and the .psh files need to be on the same directory than the 
	.bmp's. If you put them separated, they won't be loaded.

3) How do I make the files?

	The best way to start is getting one skin and modifying it. Once you understand
	how everything works, you might be confident on starting from your own work.

	Notes for graphics:

		You can make them the way you want, with the bitdepth appropiated. Support for other
		fileformats than .bmp are not planned (they would require specific loaders).

	Notes for info files:

	mach.psm (machines info)
	------------------------

	The following values tell psycle how your bitmap file is formatted (this is, where are the 
	graphics and which size do they have.
	Coords are top, left, width height


	"master_source"=0,153,189,22         <---- GraphicBox for master.
	"generator_source"=0,6,195,112       <---- GraphicBox for the Generator machines
	"generator_vu0_source"=0,0,4,6       <---- the highlighted vu graphic, the Width also tells the VU's block size.
	"generator_vu_peak_source"=157,0,4,6 <---- the "peak" vu graphic (which is left when the vu goes down)
	"generator_pan_source"=196,39,8,9    <---- the pan handle graphic 
	"generator_mute_source"=233,0,28,27  <---- the mute highlighted graphic 
	"generator_solo_source"=195,0,37,38  <---- the solo highlighted graphic 

	"effect_source"=0,118,227,32        <----- GraphicBox for Effect machines
	"effect_vu0_source"=0,150,2,3       <----- the highlighted vu graphic, the Width also tells the VU's block size.
	"effect_vu_peak_source"=41,150,2,3  <----- the chunk of the vu that is left when the vu goes down
	"effect_pan_source"=196,39,8,9      <----- the pan handle graphic
	"effect_mute_source"=197,51,19,11   <----- the mute highlighted graphic
	"effect_bypass_source"=221,51,21,10 <----- the bypass highlighted graphic

	If you do not want a vu on either machine you may set the height of the vu0_source to 0.


	The following values tell psycle how has it to draw the different objects.
	Here, the coords are relative to the top left corner of the source graphic.
 	(i.e. the top left of the gen/fx graphic is 0,0 .. *not* the top left of mach.bmp)


	"generator_vu_dest"=19,44,156 <---- top, left, width coords of the whole vumeter.
	"generator_pan_dest"=90,67,76 <---- top, left, width coords of the pan. subtract the width of the pan graphic from the total width.
	"generator_mute_dest"=51,68 <---- top, left coords of the mute button
	"generator_solo_dest"=11,62 <----top,left coords of the solo button
	"generator_name_dest"=16,20 <---- top,left cords of the machine text

	"effect_vu_dest"=18,9,40    <---- top, left and width coords of the whole vumeter
	"effect_pan_dest"=117,20,71 <---- top, left and width coords of the pan. subtract the width of the pan graphic from the total width.
	"effect_mute_dest"=173,5    <---- top, left coords of the mute button
	"effect_bypass_dest"=197,5  <----top,left coords of the bypass button
	"effect_name_dest"=62,4     <---- top,left cords of the machine text

	"transparency"=0000ff00  <---- RGB value of the colour that is to be used as transparency.
					Leave this value out if your skin has no tranparency so that psycle can use the faster opaque mode renderer


	head.psh (headers info)
	-----------------------

	The following values tell psycle how your bitmap file is formatted (this is, where are the 
	graphics and which size do they have.
	Coords are top, left, width height

	"background_source"=0,0,106,16 <---- Background graphic for the header.
	"number_0_source"=0,16,7,12    <---- graphic for the number 0. The others have to follow as "123456789" and have the same size.
	"record_on_source"=70,16,9,9   <---- hihlighted record on button
	"mute_on_source"=79,16,9,9     <---- highlighted mute
	"solo_on_source"=88,16,9,9     <---- highlighted solo

	If you do not want any track numbers then make the height of the numbers 0.

	The following values tell psycle how has to draw the different objects.
	Here, the coords are relative to the top left corner of the source graphic.
 	(i.e. the top left of the gen/fx graphic is 0,0 .. *not* the top left of head.bmp)


	"digit_x0_dest"=10,2		<---- Position for the left digit
	"digit_0x_dest"=17,2		<---- position for the right digit
	"record_on_dest"=40,4		<---- position for the record button
	"mute_on_dest"=63,4		<---- position for the mute button
	"solo_on_dest"=85,4		<---- position for the solo button

	"transparency"=0000ff00  <---- 00BBGGRR . Colour that is to be used as transparency.
	                                Note: It is important that you put the number next to the equal sign!
					Leave this value out if your skin has no tranparency so that psycle can use the faster opaque mode renderer
