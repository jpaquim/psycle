						On a near future, i (bohan) plan on adding builds for debian unstable and debian stable.
					</div>
				</div>
				Then, update you local list of packages:

				This is probably the most painful operating system for software distribution,
				as it doesn't come with any standard system for
				distributing packages,
				automatically resolving/downloading their dependencies,
				and with consistent versions accross all packages installed system-wide,
				or at least support for multiple versions simultaneously installed.
				(This operating system is not a distribution, it's both proprietary and anarchic).
				<br/>
				This means we have to track all psycle's dependencies and bundle them
				into a custom, giant, monolithic "package",
				which is self-contained and not meant to be installed system-wide,
				but rather, locally in each user's home dir.
				This makes the "package" very big (it's a mini distro itself),
				but works around all the defficiencies mentionned above.
				<br/>				
				Anyway, here are the available, self-contained, raw "packages":

					<br/>
					or for a particular version, download one of the <code>psycle_*.*.*.tar.gz</code> file from the <a href='./packages/standard-source-tarball/'/> directory.
				</part>
				<part caption='Using the Debian archive and APT'>
					There is a Debian archive in the <a href='./debian/'/> directory,
					which lists both
					<a href='./debian/dists/unstable/unstable/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz'>binary-i386 packages</a>, and
					<a href='./debian/dists/source/unstable/main/source/Sources.gz'>source packages</a>.
					<br/>
					To let APT find the archive and look into it for source packages,
					add the following lines to your <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>:
					<div class='indented'>
						<code>
							# psycle source packages
							<br/>
							deb-src http://psycle.sourceforge.net/debian unstable main
						</code>
						<div class='indented'>
							You can choose either <code>unstable</code>, <code>testing</code> or <code>stable</code>,
							This setting is independant of the main debian distribution you use:
							all source packages build fine on any debian distribution, stable, testing or unstable.

					</div>
					Then, update you local list of packages:
					<div class='indented'>
						<code>
							apt-get update

					</div>
					Psycle is currently distributed as several debian binary packages,
					but all those binary packages are built from a single source package,
					called <code>psycle</code>.
					<br/>
					To download this source package, do:
					<div class='indented'>
						<code>
							cd /tmp
							<br/>
							apt-get source psycle
							<br/>
							cd psycle-*.*.*
						</code>
					</div>
					Building the source package requires that you have some other packages installed,
					like a c++ compiler, linker, make, the development files of the libraries psycle depends on, etc.
					You can tell APT to download and install these dependency packages by issuing the following command:
					<div class='indented'>
						<code>
							apt-get build-dep psycle
						</code>
					</div>
				</part>
				<part caption='Other package-archiving systems'>

				<part caption='GNU-Arch archive' anchor='GNU-Arch'>

					<br/>
					(<a href='./gnu-arch.xml'>getting started with GNU-Arch</a>)
					<br/>
					In short, once you have installed Tom Lord's implementation of GNU-Arch, aka the tla package,
					to download the sources, do:
					<div class='indented'>
						<code>
							tla register-archive http://psycle.sourceforge.net/gnu-arch
							<br/>
							cd /tmp
							<br/>
							tla get psycle@sourceforge.net/psycle--mainline
							<br/>
							cd psycle--mainline--*
							<br/>
							./packageneric/generic/bin/autotools.bootstrap
						</code>
					</div>
					The last command, <code>./packageneric/generic/bin/autotools.bootstrap</code> will
					generate the configure script (amongst other files),
					which is not included in the archive since it is an autogenerated file.
				</part>
			</part>
			<part caption='Building the source package'>
				Psycle's source package uses the GNU build system (autoconf, automake, libtool, pkg-config).
				You don't need to have these tools installed but pkg-config.
				Also, you will need to have a c++ compiler, linker, make, and the development files of the libraries psycle depends on.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				On debian, you can tell APT to download and install these dependency packages by issuing the following command:
				<div class='indented'>
					<code>
						apt-get build-dep psycle
					</code>
				</div>
				On other systems, to view the dependencies, read the file
				<a href='./debian/dists/source/unstable/main/source/Sources.gz'/> for the latest unstable version of the source package, or
				the file <code>psycle_*.*.*.dsc</code> in the <a href='./debian/'/> directory for a particular version of the source package.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				The GNU build system follows the standard two-step build procedure of unices source packages:
				<ol>
					<li>
						<code>configure</code>:
						detection of system characteristics, and configuration of the build options
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>make</code>:
						execution of the make files which describe the actual build commands as configured in the previous step
						(compilation, linking, moving of files to installation destination)
					</li>
				</ol>
				You can also build from within the IDE of your choice.
				<part caption='Building from a GNU system for the same GNU system' anchor='build'>
					<div class='indented'>
						<code>
							cd psycle-*
							<br/>
							mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build

							<br/>
							make install-strip
							<br/>
							cd ../psycle-install-dir
							<br/>
							tree
							<br/>
							./bin/psycle
						</code>
					</div>
					You can also simply use the script named <code>./packageneric/generic/bin/build</code> which comes with the source package and does
					the <code>mkdir &amp;&amp; cd</code>, <code>configure</code> and <code>make</code> steps.

						Note that the c++ runtime needs to be distributed (either statically compiled or as a shared lib)
						with the compiled binaries, as mingw doesn't use msvc's c++ runtime lib (msvc<b>p</b>*.dll).
						<br/>
						So, once you've installed the mingw32 package, do:
						<div class='indented'>
							<code>
								cd psycle-*

								<br/>
								../configure --host=<em>i586-mingw32msvc</em> --prefix=/mnt/smbfs/psycle-mswindows-install-dir

						</div>
						Note about <code><em>i586-mingw32msvc</em></code>, this will vary depending on what toolchain you have installed.
						It could be <code><em>i686-pc-mingw32</em></code>, for example.
						Do <code>ls /usr/lib/gcc</code> or <code>ls /usr/lib/gcc-lib</code> to view what toolchains you have installed.
						<div class='indented'>
