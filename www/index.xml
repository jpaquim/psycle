		<b>Psycle's main site is the Psycledelics site<br/>(<a href='http://psycle.pastnotecut.org'/>)</b>.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		There you can find news about the developement of Psycle itself, plugins, songs, and a great forum
		with several boards (tech board, tips board, ...) where you can easily find information, help and
		even find the developers.
		That site born with Psycle (even before being  added to sourceforge). That's why it remains
		as the reference site.

		We put here, at http://psycle.sourceforge.net/,
		some bleeding-edge, "unofficial" builds, which are not intended to be the mainstream distribution,
		and files and information interesting rather the developpers than the end-users.
		Also, there are documents on a wiki service, which content is inherently unofficial, due to the open nature of wiki.

		This codebase of psycle represents years of development and is quite mature.
		The use of Psycle's sources and binaries are currently not restricted by any licence.
		If the psycledelics community ever decides to use a licence, it will surely be some Free/Libre Software License, like for example the GNU Public Licence, which would strengthen its freedom.
		<part caption='Binary raw packages'>
			The builds here are distributed as raw archives (no installer). They contain the psycle application, all the open source native plugins, and the documentation.

				<a href='./packages/microsoft/psycle.mfc.bin.zip'/>
				<br/>
				The very latest build. This might be unstable ; use at your own risk ; you may very well trash your tune! ( It already happened to several people, so sure it will happen again. )
				<br/>
				This is built from the <code>trunk</code> directory of the subversion repository.
				<br/>
				<b>Note:</b> This might be compiled with SSE2 instructions of the x86 CPUs ; only recent CPUs have SSE2 support.

		<part caption='Downloading the sources'>
			To checkout the head of <code>trunk</code> (main branch) of the subversion repository, issue the following command:
			<div class='indented'>
				<code>
					svn checkout https://psycle.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/psycle/trunk psycle-trunk
				</code>
			</div>
			Later, to update your local copy, you can just do:
			<div class='indented'>
				<code>
					cd psycle-trunk
					<br/>
					svn update
				</code>
			</div>
			Tip:
			<div class='indented'>
				You can retrieve a particular revision by checking out the url:
				<code>https://psycle.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/psycle/tags/psycle-x.y.z-stable</code>
				<br/>
				Remember that if you do so, <code>svn update</code> will likely not give you any more changes, apart maybe bugfixes,
				since stable versions are mostly frozen.

		After several experiments based on the original psycle sources (WTL, FT2 sampler, win32-generics), Satoshi started a new codebase from scratch.
		<br/>
		jaz has taken the FT2 sampler source that Satoshi did, put it in the mainline version of psycle (MFC), and did many improvements on it,
		so Satoshi's original work on the FT2 sampler isn't a lost abandonned effort.
