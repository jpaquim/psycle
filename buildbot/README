This directory contains configuration files for
the buildbot software, which can be found on debian/ubuntu
(since etch/dapper) -- the buildbot package,
or otherwise at http://buildbot.sourceforge.net

The svn_watcher.py file is a program that should
be run as a deamon to poll for updates in subversion
repositories. This is needed for repositories at
sourceforge where we cannot install our own
commit hook scripts to inform the build master
bot that updates are available.
