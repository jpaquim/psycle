microsoft:
	
*	for vcproj, use InheritedPropertySheets pointing to vcprops files.
	-- bohan

*	microsoft needs to #include <packageneric/package/meta-information.private.hpp> which is not distributed.
	since it's generated by configure from packageneric/generic/detail/src/packageneric/package/meta-information.private.hpp.in
	Since this file doesn't contain any platform nor build -specific definitions, it could be created by autogenerate.
	-- bohan

config headers:
	
*	to allow for static libraries to be built,
	split packageneric/package/modules/*/defines.private.hpp
	into two separate files: meta-informations.private.hpp and sources.private.hpp.
	then source.private.hpp can be included by client sources,
	while still having their own meta-informations.private.hpp.
	Possibly sources.private.hpp could be installed like gtk packages do, in $(libdir)/include
	(new automake var pkglibincludedir = $(pkglib)/include, and use of stanza nobase_pkglibinclude_HEADERS)
	Note that .pc files have Requires.private for static libs, but,
	making the additional -I cflag only active for static build would then require an additional .pc file,
	which would never be invoked directly. Anyway the file has a .private.hpp extension which already denote
	it's not part of the public interface, and it doesn't contain any functions or objects.

*	split packageneric/generic/detail/src/packageneric/packages/configurations/**/configuration.private.hpp(.in)
	into two separate files: host.private.hpp(.in) and install.private.hpp(.in)
	This is not really needed as it doesn't bring any more modularity.
	-- bohan
	
*	configure should set PACKAGENERIC__COMPILER__*flags instead of *FLAGS directly.
	addition is already done in packageneric/generic/detail/libexec/autogenerate/@0/package/modules.
	need to edit packageneric/generic/detail/autotools/autoconf/gnu-compiler-and-linker-flags.ac
	-- bohan

wrappers:

*	readd the packageneric/generic/detail/libexec/colorizers to the PATH env var.
	-- bohan
	
*	change bin/colorgcc to reflect gcc 4.0 that has changed the `x' notation to 'x'.
	-- bohan

pkg-config:	

*	packageneric/generic/detail/libexec/build
	PKG_CONFIG_PATH contains the configure --prefix=xxx/lib always as a unix path.
	moreover configure can be passed a --libdir different than --prefix=xxx/lib.
	Also, it has to be defined in the configure script,
	because invoking the make command directly may retrigger the configure script.
	-- bohan

*	Honor pkg-config 0.18 Requires.private
	-- bohan
	
*	m4 macro PACKAGENERIC__MODULE__EXTERNAL should allow to just test wether the package is available or not.
	-- bohan
	
*	m4 macro PACKAGENERIC__MODULE__GROUP to allow grouping several modules into a "package".
	-- bohan
	
*	Collect all the dependencies graphviz digraph dot files of nested source packages into the parent one.
	Nested packages are configured after their parent one, so, to do this, write the body to a separate file.
	Check whether it's possible to perform some actions at the end of configure, after subpackages are configured.
	Otherwize concatenation will have to be done during make.

misc:

			INSTALL_PROGRAM += -s
		else
			DEB_DH_STRIP_ARGS = --keep-debug
		endif
	-- bohan
	
*	change naming convention for links from @* to @@* ; @* stays a cut rule.
	-- bohan

*	determine type of terminal to make the echo function output
	font-change escape sequences correctly in all cases.
	It should disable escapes by default when outputting to a file unless told to use escape explicitly.
	Also, some terminals have annoying blinking instead of bold.
	-- bohan

*	installwatch, checkinstall
	-- bohan

*	remember to update the TODO file.
	-- bohan



======== done but needs more testing ========



*	macosx's /usr/bin/which command is silly. use builtin 'type' instead.
	this is already changed in most, if not all places.
