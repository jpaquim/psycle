Clicking a generator box at its GEN letters turns it to SOLO mode;
Clicking an effect box at its EFF letters turns it to BYPASS mode;
Clicking a generator or effect box somewhere at the bottom turns it to MUTE mode.

A couple of seconds of practise will make this behaviour intuitive.
I think this skin will be useful for ppl who use Psycle in 800x600 or other
try-to-add-as-many-generators-you-can maniacs.

This skin is based on 404's RGB skin but it's (imho) more handy and looks nicer.
I used the color scheme similiar to Sephid-Chocolate because I like it most.
