OK, so you've just found Psycle, you've downloaded it, installed it and
can't wait to start making music! But where to begin? When you start up
Psycle, you have a blue screen with a rectange in the middle that says
"Master".

<p class="head2">Psycle Concept No. 1</p>
Before you can enter any melodies, percussion or other notes, you have
to set up Psycle to play or create your sounds. Here is where the first
of the two main concepts of Psycle come in: Using Psycle is like using
all those old hardware synths, which you would connect via cables to
effects boxes, which would then be connected to your amplifier and then
your speakers - the only difference here is that it's all virtual.
<p>In Psycle, these virtual synths and effects are called <a
	href="Machine_Types.htm">machines</a>, which are broken into two types:
Generators and Effects. Generators create the sounds, and effects modify
them. You will see them represented with boxes like the ones below (they
can be changed by <a href="Config_Skins.htm">Skinning</a>). The Master
machine (the first one you see when you start up Psycle) is your virtual
mixer. (Later on, you'll find that there is another <a
	href="Internal_Mixer.htm">mixer machine </a>)</p>
<p>Most of the Psycle machines are plugins, which means you can add
new ones besides those that come with Psycle. There are three
categories: Internal, Native and VSTs. Internal machines are built into
Psycle, Native plugins are designed specifically for psycle, and VST is
a standard by Steinberg to create virtual synthesys (have a look at <a
	href="http://www.kvr-vst.com">www.kvr-vst.com</a> - there are many out
there!).</p>
<p class="head2">Making some noise</p>
<p>So, now that you know what Psycle machines are, it's time to use
them! To add machines in your song, you need to open the "New machine"
window by pressing F9 <b><i>OR</i></b> going to the menu item <i>View
&gt; Add New Machine <b>OR</b></i> double clicking the background. If
the list on the left-hand side of the window is not split up into
"Generators" and "Effects", change the "Group Machines" radiobutton to
"By Host type".</p>
<p>Click the "+" beside "Generators" item to expand the list. Go
down the list until you find "Arguru Synth 2", select it and click
OK. You will now see that there is now another box on the blue area,
which is the generator you just selected. This generator can't produce
any audible sound yet, because it's not connected to the Master machine.
To do this, right click over Arguru synth and drag from the generator to
the Master machine. You will see a line appears between the two, with a
triangle pointing towards the Master Machine. This indicates that sound
will go from the generator to the Master Machine.</p>

<p>At last, time to make some noise! If the generator isn't selected
already (indicated by two little lines over each corner, or by the third
combobox in the Psycle toolbar), click on a non-active part of it (i.e.
where there's no buttons or sliders), and then press "Q-W-E-R-E-W-Q"
(without the dashes). Congratulations, you've made your first sounds
with Psycle! This demonstrates another feature of Psycle - playing notes
from your computer keyboard.</p>
