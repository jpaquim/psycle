<p class="head2">Mixer Machine</p>
<p>The send-return mixer is a very adaptable machine that allows to work with Psycle in a completely different way than what you're used up to now.<br>
It adapts to the number of wires connected, so it doesn't use any more screen space than the neededf</p>
<p>In its most simple way you can use it to control the volume of up to 12 signals (like if it was another master machine). But even then, it is more functional, giving panning per channel, vu-meters and separated gain from volume slider.
</p>
<p>
In its intermediate functionality, it lets you have up to 12 effects connected to it, and send part (or all) of each of the input channels to them, and mix them all at output, controling the volume of the audio returning from the effects.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in its most complex way of working, you can use several effects in chain in one send, route the output of one send to another, and almost convert any song done with connecting machines between them, to use the mixer.
