A quick doc on skinning psycle
------------------------------

1) Preface, What is skinnable?

	There are three things skinnable right now, the Machine boxes in the machine view, 
	the Pattern headers in the pattern editor, and the controls in the parameters view of 
	native plugins, including the mixer and the master.

	These parts support different sizes and also transparency.

2) What do I need in order to skin?

	You need to make eight files, five for graphics, and three for image information.
	(Older versions used five files)
	These files are as follows:

		your_machine_graphics_name.bmp
		your_knob_graphics_name.bmp
		your_mixer_graphics_name.bmp
		your_master_graphics_name.bmp
		your_header_graphics_name.bmp
		your_machine_graphics_info_.psm
		your_controls_graphics_info_.psc
		your_header_graphics_info.psh

	Usually, they are packed inside a directory.
	
	There is a requirement about file placement and file names. They have to be in the
	same directory, and names of .bmp files need to be the same (except extension) than
	the info files.
	Example:
		PsycleSkinMachine.bmp
		PsycleSkinMachine.psm
		PsycleSkinHeader.bmp
		PsycleSkinHeader.psh
		PsycleSkinControls.bmp
		PsycleSkinControls.psc
		PsycleSkinMixer.bmp  (configured inside PsycleSkinControls.psc)
		PsycleSkinMaster.bmp (configured inside PsycleSkinControls.psc)

3) How do I make the files?

	The best way to start is getting one skin and modifying it. Once you understand
	how everything works, you might be confident on starting from your own work.

	Notes for graphics:

		You can make them the way you want, with the bitdepth appropiated. Support for other
		fileformats than .bmp are not planned (they would require specific loaders).
		On Mixer and master, only the graphics can be changed, not the sizes. The knobs also have a fixed size.
		
	The elements required are as follows:

		Master Machine
		Generator (with unselected mute and solo buttons)
		Effect (with unselected mute and bypass buttons)
		VU element (full length - can be different for effects and generators)
		VU peak (the chunk that remains when the rest of the VU goes down)
		Pan handle (i.e. the bit you move along the slide)
		Highlighted solo, bypass and mute buttons (mute buttons for generators and effects can be different)


	Notes for info files:

	mach.psm (machines info)
	------------------------

	The following values tell psycle how your bitmap file is formatted (this is, where are the 
	graphics and which size do they have.
	Coords are top, left, width height


	"master_source"=0,153,189,22         <---- GraphicBox for master.
	"generator_source"=0,6,195,112       <---- GraphicBox for the Generator machines
	"generator_vu0_source"=0,0,4,6       <---- the highlighted vu graphic, the Width also tells the VU's block size.
	"generator_vu_peak_source"=157,0,4,6 <---- the "peak" vu graphic (which is left when the vu goes down)
	"generator_pan_source"=196,39,8,9    <---- the pan handle graphic 
	"generator_mute_source"=233,0,28,27  <---- the mute highlighted graphic 
	"generator_solo_source"=195,0,37,38  <---- the solo highlighted graphic 

	"effect_source"=0,118,227,32        <----- GraphicBox for Effect machines
	"effect_vu0_source"=0,150,2,3       <----- the highlighted vu graphic, the Width also tells the VU's block size.
	"effect_vu_peak_source"=41,150,2,3  <----- the chunk of the vu that is left when the vu goes down
	"effect_pan_source"=196,39,8,9      <----- the pan handle graphic
	"effect_mute_source"=197,51,19,11   <----- the mute highlighted graphic
	"effect_bypass_source"=221,51,21,10 <----- the bypass highlighted graphic

	If you do not want a vu on either machine you may set the height of the vu0_source to 0.
	If you do not want vu peak indicator on either machine, you may set the width of the vu_peak_source to 0.


	The following values tell psycle how should it draw the different objects.
	Here, the coords are relative to the top left corner of the source graphic.
 	(i.e. the top left of the gen/fx graphic is 0,0 .. *not* the top left of mach.bmp)


	"generator_vu_dest"=19,44,156 <---- top, left, width coords of the whole vumeter.
	"generator_pan_dest"=90,67,76 <---- top, left, width coords of the pan. subtract the width of the pan graphic from the total width.
	"generator_mute_dest"=51,68 <---- top, left coords of the mute button
	"generator_solo_dest"=11,62 <----top,left coords of the solo button
	"generator_name_dest"=16,20 <---- top,left cords of the machine text
	"generator_name_clip_coords"=0,0 <----- width and height of the clipping area for the name. 0,0 means do not clip.

	"effect_vu_dest"=18,9,40    <---- top, left and width coords of the whole vumeter
	"effect_pan_dest"=117,20,71 <---- top, left and width coords of the pan. subtract the width of the pan graphic from the total width.
	"effect_mute_dest"=173,5    <---- top, left coords of the mute button
	"effect_bypass_dest"=197,5  <----top,left coords of the bypass button
	"effect_name_dest"=62,4     <---- top,left cords of the machine text
	"effect_name_clip_coords"=0,0 <----- width and height of the clipping area for the name. 0,0 means do not clip.

	"transparency"=0000ff00  <---- RGB value of the colour that is to be used as transparency.
					Leave this value out if your skin has no tranparency so that psycle can use the faster opaque mode renderer


	head.psh (headers info)
	-----------------------

	The following values tell psycle how your bitmap file is formatted (this is, where are the 
	graphics and which size do they have).
	Since Psycle 1.11.3, there are two headers. One with track names, and the other without.
	Coords are top, left, width height

	== Header without track names
	
	"background_source"=0,0,106,16 <---- Background graphic for the header.
	"number_0_source"=0,16,7,12    <---- graphic for the number 0. The others have to follow as "123456789" and have the same size.
	"record_on_source"=70,16,9,9   <---- Enabled record button
	"mute_on_source"=79,16,9,9     <---- Enabled mute button
	"solo_on_source"=88,16,9,9     <---- Enabled solo button
	"playing_on_source"=0,40,8,17  <---- Highlighted playing indicator

	If you do not want any track numbers then make the width of the numbers 0.
	If you don't want playing indicator, comment or do not add the playing_on_source line.

	The following is one of the four new blocks of data for mouse tracking. 
	This first group indicate the graphics location for the classic header highlight
	Width and height coupled with destination tracking designate the clickable area
	"record_tracking_source"=59,24,18,18	<---- Position of the record tracking image (can be the same than record_on_source)
	"mute_tracking_source"=95,24,18,18		<---- Position of the mute tracking image (can be the same than mute_on_source)
	"solo_tracking_source"=77,24,18,18		<---- Position of the solo tracking image (can be the same than solo_on_source)

	
	
	The following values tell psycle how has to draw the different objects.
	Here, the coords are relative to the top left corner of the source graphic.
 	(i.e. the top left of the gen/fx graphic is 0,0 .. *not* the top left of head.bmp)

	"digit_x0_dest"=10,2		<---- Position for the left digit
	"digit_0x_dest"=17,2		<---- position for the right digit

	"playing_on_dest"=8,3   <---- position for the playing indicator.

	Second group of mouse tracking extension. These designate the placement on the classic header for the hightlights.
	source Width and height coupled with destination designate the clickable area
	"record_tracking_dest"=59,2		<---- Destination of the record tracking image (can be the same than record_on_dest)
	"mute_tracking_dest"=95,2		<---- Destination of the mute tracking image (can be the same than mute_on_dest)
	"solo_tracking_dest"=77,2		<---- Destination of the solo tracking image (can be the same than solo_on_dest)
	

	== Header with track names. An alternate header for showing the track names.

	"text_background_source"=0,60,113,23	<---- Background graphic for the track names header.
	"text_number_0_source"=0,44,7,12		<---- graphic for the number 0. The others have to follow as "123456789" and have the same size.

	"text_playing_on_source"=0,83,17,10		<---- Highlighted playing indicator

	This third group indicate the graphics location for the track names header highlight
	Width and height of the source with the top and left destination designate the clickable area
	"text_record_tracking_source"=3,115,54,8   <---- Position of the record tracking image (can be the same than text_record_on_source)

	"text_solo_tracking_source"=57,106,54,8    <---- Position of the solo tracking image (can be the same than text_solo_on_source)

	// destination coords to be rendered to
	// destinations use 0,0 as top left of background

	"text_font_name"=Arial		<--- Font face for the track names header text.
	"text_font_point"=40    	<--- Font size for the track names header text. Note: The number is in hexadecimal format.
	"text_font_flags"=0			<--- Font flag for the track names header text. 0=normal, 1=bold, 2=italic, 3=bold+italic.
	
	
	"transparency"=0000ff00  <---- 00BBGGRR . Colour that is to be used as transparency.
	                                Note: It is important that you put the number next to the equal sign!
					Leave this value out if your skin has no tranparency so that psycle can use the faster opaque mode renderer

	controls.psc (controls info)
	-----------------------
	Originally, the controls of Psycle were not skinnable. In version 1.8, the ability to change the settings and skin the knob
	control was added.
	And finally, in version 1.11, the ability to skin the master machine window and the send return mixer controls was added.
	
	Controls.psc is the file used for version 1.11 and above.
	Coords are top, left, width height
