///\brief the version number of the psycle playback engine.

/// M.m.p , where:
/// 	- M = major version number.
/// 	- m = minor version number:
/// 		- if even, then it's a stable release.
/// 		- if odd, then it's an unstable build or release candidate for next stable minor version number.
/// 	- p = patch number:
/// 		- if the minor version number is even (stable release), then this patch number is used for bug fixes, so, it's hopefully rarely incremented.
/// 		- if the minor version number is odd (unstable builds), then this patch number is incremented very often, each cvs commit.

/// Other files that need to be updated accordingly:
/// - make/doxygen/doxygen.configuration: PROJECT_NUMBER
/// - doc/for-end-users/readme.txt
/// - doc/for-end-users/whatsnew.txt
/// ... if only we were using a programmable build system like autoconf.
