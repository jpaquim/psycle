Now that you've got your sounds working, it's time to enter some notes to make a proper song.
To open the pattern window, press F3 <b><i>OR</i></b> go to the menu <i>View &gt; Pattern Editor</i>.  A Psycle song consists of patterns which are then sequenced.  A pattern is made up of rows and tracks.
<p>

</p>
<p>Each row corresponds to a time interval. With the default
Line-per-beat setting of 4, that means that every row corresponds to a
dem-semi-quaver, or 16th-note. However, this does not mean that a note
is restricted to a 16th-note duration - that depends on the settings of
the generator and Note-Off commands. It is analogous to having a piano
score with every note and rest written out as tied 16th notes (or
whatever time interval applies).
</p>
<p>
Each track is like channels on a mixer - it allows notes from different generators to be played simultaneously.
</p>
<p class="head2">Entering Notes</p>
Now you're in the pattern window, it's time to enter some notes.
Firstly, some explanation of the format of the notes is needed. Each
entry for a note looks like this:

<p></p>
<center>
<code> --- .. .. .... <br>

C-4 01 00 0D7F <br>

A-3 .. 00 ....
</code></center>


<p>For now, all you really need to know about is the note name (e.g.
C-4) and the generator number (3rd column) which are pretty much self
explanatory once you know where they are. Now, to enter some notes, go
to a track and click on the part of a note entry position where the
note-name goes. Now, press Q, down arrow, W, down arrow, E, down arrow.
You should see several notes there. Notice that the machine number is automatically entered by Psycle. It uses the generator selected in the machine combobox (in the toolbar).</p>
<p>If you're using samples, the only difference in playing notes is
that the sample number (which is the other combobox in the toolbar) is shown in the second column e.g.</p>
<p></p>
<center>
<code> C-4 02 01 .... <br>

</code></center>


<p>
where the sample number is 02 and the generator number is 01.</p>
<br>
A special key to be aware of is the "Note Off" key, which sends a
"noteoff" message to the specified generator, allowing you to decide
when to stop a playing note. Press the key "1" above the QWERTY keys.
You would see a like like this:<br>

<center>
<code>
off .. 00 .... </code></center>
<p>Note: You might need to change the Envelope values ( amp envelope,
VCA envelope...)&nbsp;of the machine to get the duration that you
search for.</p>
