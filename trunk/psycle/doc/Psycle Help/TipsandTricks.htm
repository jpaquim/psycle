<ul>
	<li>Press Ctrl + Tab to expand the pattern editor/machine view,
	and again to shrink it.</li>
	<li>Save a new copy of your file each time you make a major change
	- if you don't like it, you can easily go back to the old file.</li>
</ul>

<p class="head3"><a name="machineview">Machine View</a></p>
<ul>
	<li>Group machines together, either with a gainer plugin or a
	mastering plugin e.g. a compressor, to simplify your connections to the
	<a href="Machine_Master.htm">Master Machine</a> and avoid going of the
	limit of 12 connections.</li>
	<li>You can <a href="Machine_Wires.htm">monitor</a> more than one
	connection at once - just double click on each wire that you want to
	monitor, and drag the windows to make them all visible at once.</li>
	<li>Instead of just connecting a generator through an effect and
	then straight to the second effect, connect a second wire directly from
	the generator to the second effect. Then, set the wet signal of the
	effect to 100%. Do this with several generators and the same effect,
	and the wet and dry signal volumes for each generator can be easily
	changed, using the wires that leave each generator. This works well
	where processing of the invidual signals is not needed later on in the
	chain.<br />
	Of course, you can also use the <a href="Internal_Mixer.htm">Mixer machine</a></li>
	<li>When you only want to listen to several generators at once,
	solo one of them, then unmute the others.</li>
	<li>In the Machine View, rename the machines that you've inserted
	into your song from the default names to make them more meaningful -
	"Main saw synth" is more useful than "reFX Vanguard 5".</li>
</ul>

<p class="head3"><a name="patterneditor">Pattern Editor</a></p>
<ul>
	<li>You can import patterns from a different project - just save
	them as <a href="FileFunc_psb.htm">.psb</a> files using the <a
		href="FileFunc_New.htm">Export</a> command and then import them in your
	new file. To import, one option is to drag the file into Psycle</li>
	<li>Edit the names of your samples in the <a
		href="Sampler_InstrumentEditor.htm">Instrument Editor</a> to make them
	more meaningful instead of things like "bd_sample_1065.wav".</li>
	<li>Percussion samples (or any samples for that matter) can be
	played at different pitches to produce some useful sounds.</li>
	<li>Be consistent with your tracks - keep the same set of
	instruments/synths in a particular track number. It will help you to
	keep more organised, and make it easier to go back and change various
	parts.</li>
	<li>When you only want to listen to a few elements, click the solo
	button for one of the tracks, and unmute the others.</li>
	<li>You can play one note or one row at a time - make sure the
	cursor is in the note-part of the track, and press 4 or 8 respectively
	(these shortkeys can be changed, of course).</li>
</ul>
