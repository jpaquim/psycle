<b>Render As Wav</b>
(File &gt; Render as Wav...) &ndash; Saving as a Windows PCM Wav
('*.wav') in various sample rates and bit depths (the greater the bit
depth and sample rate, the closer it is to an analogue waveform and
therefore the sound quality will be better). The checkboxes provide a
way to separate various elements of the track (either by each input to
the master, the track or the machine), so that they can be mixed and
mastered separately.
<p />

<p><b>Note:</b> A few native plugins have problems with different
sample rates e.g. the lfo in some of Pooplog's plugins behaves
differently at different sample rates. To avoid this, if possible, work
in the same sample rate that you will render in.</p>
<p><img src="diskrecord.jpg" align="bottom" /><b> Record wav</b> &ndash; records a
'.wav' file in real time - as sounds are played in Psycle they are
recorded directly to disk. It will start recording as soon as you select
the .wav file, and will stop recording after you click the button again.</p>
