<p class="head2">Instruments</p>
An instrument is essentially a <a href="InstrumentEditor_Waves.htm">sound sample</a> that can have some parameters like
envelopes and loops, and is played by one of the two sampler machines: classic sampler or Sampulse.
Since the features of the two samplers are different, there is an <a href="InstrumentEditor_Sampler.htm">
instrument editor for the sampler</a> and a different <a href="InstrumentEditor_Sampulse.htm">Instrument editor
for Sampulse</a>.<br />
There is also a basic <a href="Sampler_WaveEditor.htm">wave editor</a>
</p>
<p>All of the instrument functions can be accessed from the right
half of the <a href="Bars_Machine.htm">machine bar</a>. Once you've
added a sampler or Sampulse machine using the <a href="Machine_Add.htm">Add Machine</a>
dialogue window, to work with instruments you should make sure that
the machine is selected, and that "Instrument" is selected in the third drop-down box.</p>
<p><img src="select_sample.png" width="75" height="26" border="0"
	alt="" /></p>
<p>The next drop-down box dispays the instruments that have been
loaded (which are then stored within your psycle file). They are
numbered (in Hexadecimal) from 00 to FE (i.e. you can have a maximum of
255 different samples in your song).<br />
It should be noted that the instrument list shown when selecting a Sampulse machine is different than when selecting
a sampler machine.</p>
<p>Since Psycle 1.11, this droplist doesn't show all the positions by default.<br />
To add a new position, use the right arrow to increase beyond the visible positions.

<p class="head2">Virtual generators for instruments</p>
Instruments need a sampler or sampulse machine to be used, but this requires
to specify both in the pattern, and if there are several sampler machines, sometimes
it can be tedious to select both correctly<br />
With the idea to simplify this, there is a new feature in Psycle intended
to use instruments in patterns as if they were a machine.
Go into the <a href="Sampler_Using_Virtual.htm">chapter about virtual generators</a> to learn how to use it.
