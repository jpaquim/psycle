<center>Welcome to Psycle!</center>
<p>Psycle is a free, Open-Source, music creation program that offers
an easy way to create your own music, fast, and with high quality.</p>
<p>Psycle uses a classical tracker interface (a text grid of notes
which are sequenced one after the other), coupled with modularity
(plugins) that allow to extend the sounds that you get from it.</p>
<p>Notes are entered in <a href="PatternEd_Main.htm">patterns</a>,
where you can also use commands (plugin specific, or global), as well as
automating parameters via the mcm and twk commands. These patterns are
then organized in a <a href="Bars_Sequencer.htm">linear sequence</a>,
which becomes the song order.</p>
<p>It supports three ways to get new sounds: Its own native plugins,
the VST Plugin standard, and recorded .wav samples using the <a
	href="Sampler.htm">sampler machine</a>.<br />
Also, since version 1.8.5, Psycle has a wave-in machine to capture sound
live.</p>


<p>If this is your first time using Psycle, we recommend reading the
<a href="Tutorial.htm">Tutorial</a>. For more advanced help, browse
through the sections for each part of the interface.</p>
<p>Psycle is developed by the Psycledelics community, based at <a
