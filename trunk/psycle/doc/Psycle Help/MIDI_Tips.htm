<p class="head2">Tips &amp; Tricks</p>

<p>Do not forget to send a midi clock start if using the
Synchronized mode. No messages will get played until this is done.</p>

<p>The different audiodrivers have different implementations to get
MIDI synchronization. Wasapi is sample accurate, Waveout and Directsound
depend on drivers and ASIO is block accurate.<br />
Directsound and Waveout accuracy depend on the Operating System and
soundcard drivers, and ASIO accuracy is not better because the position
is only updated when producing audio.</p>
<p>Set the midi headroom and number of audio buffers/size to the
lowest bearable value when working on a particular song (to make things
easier to work with). If you experience the occasional glitch then this
is not a problem - you are only working on the tune - sync should still
be regained within a few milliseconds.<br />
Once you are ready to mix down your song then set the midi headroom and
audio settings to larger values (adjust midi sequencer time offsets to
take account of this with regards to the other non-Psycle tracks) for
this final mix - in order to reduce the probability of rogue system MIDI
latency or Psycle audio "drop-outs" during this mix down.</p>
<p>If you mute a Psycle-controlling track in your sequencer and the
current generator does not accept note-off messages, then you can
(sometimes) press the main Psycle STOP button in to stop all notes and
then let the MIDI restart all the others (appart from the track you
wanted to mute of course).</p>
<p>For more interesting ways of setting controllers, get a program
called CC-Mouse. This little application lets you control two parameters
at a time using the mouse. Feed the output of this program into a
virtual MIDI port and then through into your sequencer. You can then
make smooth sweeps (of say a cut-off) using the mouse and record them in
your sequencer!</p>
<p>You can play MIDIs with Psycle! Create a FluidSynth SF2 Player, load your
favourite soundfont, and set in Psycle settings, MIDI Controller, the options
Select generator: Currently selected in Psycle, Select instrument: Selected
by MIDI Channel index and Record raw MIDI as MCM. Remember that if you use
the Synchronized MIDI mode, you will need to send a clock start.<br/>
The software MIDI-OX and MidiBar can help with that, and you will
need a virtual MIDI cable, like loopBe.</p>
