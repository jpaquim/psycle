<p class="head2">Recording in real-time</p>
<p>This section of the help file talks about entering data into the
patterns in realtime. If you look for recording the audio in real-time,
see the Record Wav button in the
<a href="Bars_Toolbar.htm">toolbar</a>.</p>
This operation requires that <a href="Bars_Toolbar.htm">Pattern recording</a>
is selected in the toolbar. 
<p>To record multiple notes at once (e.g. chords), you need to "arm"
the current track - in other words, select the record button on the
header of each track (The red "R" button in the default skin). Do this for every track that you want the
notes/tweaks/mcm commands to appear in.</p>
<p />
<center><img src="header.png"  /></center>
<p>
If you only want to record notes in one track,
you don't need to arm the track, provided that the "FT2 Style Record
Behaviour in Unarmed Track" option is ticked in the <a
	href="Config_Keyboard.htm">Configuration</a> window.
</p>

<p>Then, to record, press play (F5) and play the notes with either the PC or MIDI keyboard or move the
knobs on your machines.<br/>
Remember that the <a href="PatternEd_Settings.htm#sequence">Record Tweaks</a>
checkbox on the sequencer bar must be ticked for tweaks to be recorded, and that
 <a href="PatternEd_Settings.htm#sequence">Record noteoff</a> is needed to record the release of the note.
