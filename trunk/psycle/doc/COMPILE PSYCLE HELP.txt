To copile Psycle help, it is necessary to download and install HTML Help Workshop from Microsoft.

Then, launch the program (hhw.exe) open the Psycle Help.hhp file and run compile.

It will generate some some warnings about the <?xml> header, but that's because it doesn't know about xhtml.The final results works anyway.
