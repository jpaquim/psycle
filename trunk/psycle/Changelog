	* just increasing the version number to reflect the presence of a bug fix concerning loading of skins

2005/06/07 18:16:55 psycle 1.7.54 (alpha) johan-boule

	* Version 1.7.54 (alpha)
	* oops, fix for bug introduced in 1.7.53 concerning midi device selection in the configuration

2005/06/04 00:20:25  johan-boule

	* closing sourceforge bug #1087788.
	* rearranged the midi variables which had the channel
	* number appended to their names into arrays, and replaced the
	* related repetitive code with loops.

	* The interface of the registry class used to require we
	  specify the type and size of the each value we read or
	  write. I've changed it to use function overloading for types
	  like bool, all variants of int, and std::string, and to use
	  a template for other types so they just use REG_BINARY
	  (which means any type). So we can simply pass the variable
	  to load/save and its type and size are implicit ; it's less
	  error prone and looks nicer.

	  It works correctly, but i've noticed problems loading my
	  existing registry settings because some of the types used to
	  be REG_BINARY for values that should have been REG_DWORD
	  (and iirc vice-versa), and the registry class complains
	  about type missmatch. To work around it i've changed the
	  path of the "root" key to software/psycle/psycledelics-1.7
	  (it's actually determined from the values in
	  version.hpp).... the drawback is that people "loose" their
	  old settings.

2005/05/30 05:13:43 psycle 1.7.51 (alpha) johan-boule

	* Version 1.7.51 (alpha)
	* change to let plugins find other .dll files that are in any intermediate dir between their own dir and the configured root dir for plugins

2005/05/29 23:21:23 psycle 1.7.50 (alpha) johan-boule

	* Version 1.7.50 (alpha)
	* change to let plugins find other .dll files that are in the same dir as their own .dll
	  for example, blwtbl.dll can be put along with druttis plugins instead of psycle.exe's dir.

2005/05/29 00:34:58  johan-boule

	* cvs $File -> $Id

2005/05/25 20:20:35 psycle 1.7.49 (alpha) johan-boule

	* Version 1.7.49 (alpha)
	* removed scary pointer and index stuff from the directsound config
	  (the device index value in the registry can be deleted as it's not used anymore)

2005/05/25 04:02:17 psycle 1.7.48 (alpha) johan-boule

	* Version 1.7.48 (alpha)
	* fixed bug for fingersoup's directsound driver (null GUID)

2005/05/24 01:09:17  johan-boule

	* bug fix + special 0xff voice to send the same command to all voices

2005/05/23 23:41:23  johan-boule

	* to be tested...
	  change that allows the player to send commands (Machine::Tick function) from any pattern track with a given channel (or "voice") number:

	  if the machine is not a vst, and if the note is a "mcm" (hmm, poor name if it's not related with midi),
	  then, the fields in the event are interpreted as <channel> <machine> <command> <parameter>.
	  for example, 1122334444, means:
	  11 is the channel (or "voice"),
	  22 is the machine,
	  33 is the command, and
	  4444 is the parameter
	  The player calls the Machine::Tick function with those values, and the instrument value set to 0.

2005/05/18 06:55:47  johan-boule

	* releasing voskomo's blitz plugin

2005/05/14 15:32:57  johan-boule

	* bug fix: operating_system::exceptions::translated::what() returned the address of a temporary stack object

2005/05/12 22:18:39  johan-boule

	* increased version number for alpha release
	* includes jaz's bug fixes
	* fpu exceptions disabled in the configuration "by default" as it's only useful for crazy debugging hell

2005/05/12 14:55:49  johan-boule

	* Added handling of fpu exceptions.
	  It's a build configuration option, so it can be disabled.
	  It only catches fpu exceptions in the machines' work functions, but this could be extended to other functions as well.
	  Each exception type is reported only once per machine it occurs, by growing the fpu exception mask.
	  "Inexact result" fpu exceptions are initially already masked.

	* Also, made exceptions which happen in machines appear not only in the lof, but also in a message box, because many people wondered why some machines were automagically set to bypassed/muted (The message box wouldn't be needed if the MFC logging window worked.)

2005/05/01 14:10:59  jaz001

	* More Work on Sampulse (IT Filtering, improving commands, bugfixing).
	* Removed an cleaned (a bit) old sample sources (removed the never used sample layers)
	* Added a new internal machine "Note Duplicator". It just resends the Tick comand to the specificed machines
	* Some other small changes ( Changed the way interpolation is modified, and others)

	* added src/configuration.hpp to psycle.vcproj

	 * releasing alpha version 1.7.39 -- with voskomo's gamefx plugin

2005/04/06 04:32:03  johan-boule

	* Attempt to use boost::read_write_mutex instead of an exclusive mutex for Song's lock.
	  Curiously, it dead-locks.
	  So, i made it a build option that can be enabled/disabled in src/configuration.hpp
	  
	* The version info and the about box is modified to show what build options were used (multiline text).

2005/04/02 21:48:37 psycle 1.7.37 (alpha) johan-boule
