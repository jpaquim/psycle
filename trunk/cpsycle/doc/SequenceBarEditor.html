<p class="head1">The Sequence Bar Editor</p>
<p>The Sequence Bar Editor is an extension to the Sequence Editor and a new
way where you can organise your patterns, and is located on the bottom side of
the Machines window (F2). The song progresses from left to right, and each line
represents a sequence track holding the sequence entries, that can contain a pattern,
a marker or a sample bar. The number on the left is the position number in the track,
and on the right there is either the pattern number or the sampleindex and optional the
samplerindex if assigned different than the song property one. You may use the same
indexes of pattern or samples in more than one position.</p>
