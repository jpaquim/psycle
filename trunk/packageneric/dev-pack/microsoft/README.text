psycledelics packageneric dev-pack, the generic dev-pack - version 21, mswindows/msys
=====================================================================================



===================================
Latest version always available at:
	http://psycle.sourceforge.net/packages/microsoft/dev-pack/
	Release notes (this file): http://psycle.sourceforge.net/packages/microsoft/dev-pack/release-notes/
	
	You may want to save the working-dir subdirectory of the dev-pack between upgrades of the dev-pack.



===============
Getting started

	If you have already installed on your system some of the tools provided in this dev pack,
	it doesn't matter. You should always start the tools using the provided scripts.
	The scripts set environment variables with only paths to the tools contained in this pack.
	Doing so, we are guaranted that the tools run in an environment isolated from the rest of the system,
	and hence that no external tool or configuration will interfere.

	___________________
	system requirements

	MSWindows version 5.0 (NT-2000) or later, on a NTFS file system (FAT32 won't work).
	(or better, upgrade to linux or at least colinux ;p).
	Note:
		This dev-pack has been cooked and tested on MSWindows version 5.1 (NT-XP) on a NTFS file system.
		It is possible that versions of NT-based MSWindows prior or equal to 5.0 work, but this is untested.
		All non-NT, i.e. MSDOS-based, systems, namely, MSWindows95, MSWindows95SE, MSWindows98, MSWindows98SE, MSWindowsMe, are as usual not supported.
		Wine has not been tested, but it doesn't really make sense to use this dev-pack on Wine, as you can use gcc's cross compiling abilities.

	___________________
	shell in a terminal

	To start a bash shell in an rxvt terminal, run the terminal.cmd script.
	Use it, it's good :-)

	___________
	eclipse IDE

	To start the eclipse IDE, run the eclipse.cmd script.

	The first time you start the IDE,
		- Choose "File ->  Import",
		- Choose "import existing project into the workspace",
		- Browse to the working-dir/source-packages directory, select one of the sub directories (there must be a .cdtproject file inside the directory), and click 0k,
		- Switch to the C++ perspective: "Window -> Perspective -> C++".
		- Switch to the C++ projects tab.

	You may want to save your working-dir/eclipse.workspace directory between upgrades of the dev-pack.

Change log

2005-04-26 version 21

	* added opt/gnupg 1.4.0 and .gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg (containing http://bohan.dyndns.org/~bohan/bohan.open-pgp.key-ring.asc) to verify the signatures of downloaded files
	* upgraded opt/boost to 1.32.0
	* upgraded opt/msys/share/aclocal/pkg.m4
	* activated junctions (symlinks) to have more room on path lengths (many apps bug as soon as lengths pass 260 chars or so)

2005-02-04 version 20

	* libexec/env.cmd: fixed problem which made it fails when path contains space character, even before the check to require that the path contains no space character.

2005-01-26 version 19

	* upgraded opt/eclipse cdt to 2.1.0
	* upgraded opt/doxgen to 1.4.1
	* replaced opt/rar with opt/7-zip 4.14 which is free software (contrary to rar), and compresses even better.
	* upgraded opt/wget to 1.9.1
	* opt/msys/etc/bash.bashrc: the shell prompt now automatically changes the window title of the rxvt terminal.
	* opt/msys/etc/bash.bashrc: the shell prompt now shows the exit status of the last executed command if it's non-zero.
	* libexec/env.cmd: added check to require that the username contains no space character.
	* removed opt/cygwin
	* added opt/msys/local/bin/file (a simplistic version of the 'file' command ; it only knows how to determine the type of library files from their file names, but anyway, this is all libtool needs.

2004-12-18 version 18

	* libexec/env.cmd: made opt/msys/etc/fstab automatically mount the home directories from the value of the $(dirname $USERPROFILE) env var

2004-11-25 version 17

	* upgraded opt/msys/bin/rxvt to that of msys 1.0.11-2004.04.30-1
	* fix in opt/boost/lib/pkgconfig/*.pc files
	* upgraded opt/mingw/include/dsound.h from version 8 to version 9
	* terminal.cmd: better colors for rxvt
	* opt/msys/etc/bash.bashrc: increased bash's command line history to 10k lines, and unlimited persitent size of ~/.bash_history
	* added opt/msys/local/bin/colordiff 1.4.2.10
	* added opt/listdlls 2.23

2004-10-23 version 16

	* added opt/cygwin/file 4.09 (without share/file, but it knows how to determine the type of library files anyway, which is what libtool needs)
	* added opt/mingw/include/dsound.h (version 8)

2004-10-18 version 15

	* fix in opt/boost/lib/pkgconfig/*.pc files for file-naming compatibility with libtool and/or gcc.

2004-10-12 version 14

	* added mingw-utils 0.3 to opt/mingw/ (unix2dos, dos2unix, a2dll, pexports, reimp, drmingw and its exchndl)
	* added the standard c++ lib as a dll:
		opt/mingw/bin/libstdc++.dll
		opt/mingw/bin/libsupc++.dll
		opt/mingw/lib/libstdc++.dll.a
		opt/mingw/lib/libsupc++.dll.a
		opt/mingw/lib/libstdc++.la (added entries about the shared version)
		opt/mingw/lib/libsupc++.la (added entries about the shared version)
	* added opt/gtk/share/themes/{Grand-Canyon,Smokey-Blue}

2004-10-01 version 13

	* fix in opt/boost/lib/pkgconfig/*.pc files
	* added opt/msys/share/aclocal/pkg.m4 pkg-config m4 macros for autoconf
	* removed opt/c++builderX which is not free software, not often updated, and not as good as opt/eclipse's cdt
