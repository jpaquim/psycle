# This is a sorted list, top priority at the top!

*	Source files that don't build because they are work-in-progress.
	Symptom: build failure.
	Since the build systems (both scons and the autotools) want
	to build all *.cpp files found under the src dir, don't forget
	to disable the code with something like #if 0 ... #endif.
	Alternatively, it's possible to put them in a subdir named "todo": dirs with
	that name are excluded when searching for *.cpp files.

*	windows.h
	Symptom: build failure.
	before #including <windows.h>, we need to be able to define some "options":
	#define NOMINMAX
	#define WINVER 0x510
	#define _WIN32_WINDOWS WINVER
	#define _WIN32_NT WINVER
	#define _WIN32_IE 0x600
	We can put this in a project-wide header that is always included first in every .cpp
	
*	zipwriter.cpp:
	Symptom: build failure.
	The preprocessor definition __WIN32__ does not always exist. All compilers i could check define _WIN32 (or _WIN64).
	No need to check for _MSC_VER here afaik.
	The check for __MSDOS__ ... is that a joke?
	Do not use antislashes for #include: <sys\stat.h> -> <sys/stat.h>

*	multi-threading: sigslot.h:
	Potential symptom: multi-threading problems due to wrong threading model being selected on windows platform.
	The preprocessor definition WIN32 does not always exist. All compilers i could check define _WIN32 (or _WIN64).
	(don't forget the copy in <source-of-repository>/psycle/include/sigslot.h)

*	multi-threading: ulseep
	Potential symptom: multi-threading problems due to lack of thread synchronisation.
	from the linux manpage usleep: "This function is obsolete. Use nanosleep(2) or setitimer(2) instead."
	Anyway, doing arbitrary pauses is not a long-term replacement for a proper thread synchonisation.
	For pthread: pthread_cond_wait, pthread_cond_signal, pthread_join ...
