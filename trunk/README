The current code base of psycle is stored in the portable_psycle dir.

./portable_psycle/
	Psycle from version 1.7.6 and above.
	This is probably what you want to look at since this is where the current code base of psycle is stored.

./psycle2_multisequence (removed)
	Krissce's version of psycle, with a multipattern sequencer.
	This is a fork from mainline version 1.7.6.

./Psycle/ (Capital) (removed)
	Old psycle versions until 1.7.5. (or 1.7.6?)

./psycle/ (lower case) (removed)
	Some mistake, nothing there :/
	You won't even notice this dir on case-insensitive file systems.

./test/ (removed)
	Nothing interesting here :-)
