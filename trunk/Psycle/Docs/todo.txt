*remove waits from play when in export mode
-copy paste in edit menu
-midi control commands learn
-longer sequences (256)
-more tracks (64)
-store state of follow song toggle
!DO NOT LOAD LIST VST list & database
<Alk^> do u think the recording with subtracting the buffer delay will be doable?
<Alk^> I think the line numbering should be optional
<Alk^> I also think that the cursor movement after a paste should be optional to =)<pooplog> i mean follow song, multi aud, noteoffs, tweaks, etc. could be buttons perhaps
<[JAZ]> pooplog : just to let you know it: the loop is wrongly done (on this "gap" wave thing) " on record
<bohan`> aha, yep, cause, for the machine ones, it'd be really better if it could have a log scale and be centered at "0dB"
<Pikari> oh. and I hate it when I choose skip=0 and the cursor goes to the next column :(
<_sue_> hey poop....can we have something like a right double click for inserting the first not used patter (like before with left double click)?
<_sue_> in the pattern sequencer with shift and the mouse you can select more than one pattern....but if you press del only the first one of the selection is deleted.....it would be nice if they were all deleted.... it would be nice if you could copy and paste pattern selections in the pattern seq too....(i mean blocks of patterns)
<_sue_> the pattern sequencer "mini" window could really be longer.....depending on windows screen res....in the one im using i have half of the tab where the pattern seq is completely free.....oki no more sugestions for today...hihihi
<_sue_> something like selecting a generator and having some global edit functions (in the edit menu :)  like :  delete all notes / tranpose all + 12 / delete all tweaks .....stuff like this -> for the entire song
<_sue_> and also being able to select the slot in wich you load a generator.....it goes by defaul to the first not used....sometimes i wanna switch generators and the new one goes to the wrong slot....

	*Flanger feedback slider
	 Instrument filter envelope slider. (check differences with finetune slider)

	*changing octave, make notes stop (because if not, notes playing don't stop)



-- Psycle 1.67
--------------

* Sampler Machine/Wave Ed:
--------------------------
	bug: 	 portamento to note slides too much. (can anyone test this for me?)
	feature: just have an checkbox to enable or disable the Amplitude, or the whole synthesis (phongshade)
	feature: Instruments Support ( *.xi , *.iti, *.sf2. Maybe more)
		 * samples mapped by key
		 * maybe: samples mapped by velocity?
	feature: Improve Filter support.
		 * twk Control
		 * maybe: allow filter cutoff/res mapping to velocity
	feature: volume slides/arpeggio
	feature: better way to set loop points. (+ ping-pong loops)
	feature: Easier way to load Samples.
	feature: Toolbar for the Wave Editor.
	feature: Note playback in WaveEd (Problem: Needs a sampler Machine. The wave preview is not adecuated)

* GUI (pattern):
----------------
	bug:	 Select with mouse when playing gives problems
	feature: FT2 Jumps to the top of a pattern when you move from one to another (Kris)
	feature: maybe: MultiPattern View (The code is not made in the best way)
	feature: MORE Keyboard shortcuts 
	feature: Live Parameter change Recording.
	feature: tws (Tweak Slide) Command to slide the tweak. (asked by _sue_)
	feature: First, I'd like to see the Generator or Effect name in one of these places
		 when I hover over a note in the Pattern Editor ( MrToast )

* GUI (machines):
-----------------
	feature: Saving all the missing settings to registry (like follow song, class of plugin..)
	feature: Clone Machine Button
	feature: Replace Machine by another.
	feature: Prevent duplicate names when creating Machines ( FeedMe , FeedMe 2...)
	feature: Directories in "Add new machine" (Sorting with directories)
		 Remember previous used and add "class/type" selection to registry
	feature: Internal Fx Gui to Native Gui Conversion (including wiredialog)
		 Create a new "universal" MachineFrame class, for all plugins
		 (Needs a few more changes in the class definitions)
	feature: VST/Native machine Windows : ESC = close (Problem: can't close within the CWnd!!!)
	feature: VST: support for plugin resize. (Problem: Needs to know the View Class!)
	feature: VST param highlight when modifying.
		 When changing a param with the Graphic VST GUI, select the corresponding param in
		 the list (and update the bar as well). When,which, and to which value can be
		 known using the audioMasterCallback (Problem: Needs to know the View Class!)
	bug:	 VST: Changing a parameter, changing to another window, and returning to Psycle causes
		 that parameter to get the old value again (Scrollbar problem. Solution: Update the scrollbar)
	bug: 	 VST: Param value+1 when selecting (Scrollbar precision) ( int() bug? )
	feature: Option to hide Parameters in VST GUI.
	feature: Add Presets in a "tab" under Parameters (easy switching/testing)!
	bug:     Crash bug when loading a big .fxb file, problem with deleting, etc...  (Rep. by Vibra)
		 Fix:Basically, make ONLY .fxb for VST's.
	feature: Really good looking new Master Machine.(Graphics under res\MasterMachine)
	bug:	 JMDrum is buggy (Crashes sometimes)


* Player Engine:
----------------
	bug:	 In some rare cases, when opening a song, psycle produces noise. (See "fly to the moon [non vocal].psy")
		 When opening it, a noise is produced by one machine and passed to the others. The bug doesn't happen
		 when debugging!
	bug:	 "MidiInput.cpp(359): warning #68: integer conversion resulted in a change of sign"
	bug:	 plugins which make use of the "SaveData" (native) or "SaveChunk" (VST’) can cause a crash if they are
		 missing when you load a song. Won’t get fixed by now. Needs a fileformat change.
	bug:	 New Note in Quadrasid does not reinitialize the Envelope. (Bug? This doesn't happen on freebase)
	bug:	 DirectSound Output is a bit buggy.Crashes and bad sound reported. 
	feature: Maybe: New command "twc" which will send a machine command (like note delay, to say a silly one)
		 to the machine indicated by gen, and ___>to_the_channel_indicated_by_"inst"<____!
		 (asked by Pikari)
	feature: pattern repeat (loop) and song repeat (asked by Vir|us)
	feature: Note Delay to VST's


* Importing:
------------

	bug: It doesn't add the machines necessary to play all notes.
	bug: if you import an XM file and save, the finetune of the samples is not saved (Fileformat limitation)
	feature: Add option for the user to create samplers for instruments
	feature: IT importing





-- Possible Features For Psycle 2 --
------------------------------------

* Editing Capabilities:
-----------------------
	* Multi pattern Sequencing
	* Multiple Editors (Not only tracker view)
	* Parameter Automation  ( Envelopes for Parameters )
	* Velocity/Panning/other_weird column to pattern data
	* Appregiator: One "template" note, notes "produced" by the appregiator in a different colour.
	* "zip"-able columns.
	* Tracker track? (for bpm, global volume...)
	? Notes of current selected machine marked with a different colour
	? Maybe notes/etc, of muted machines shown in grey
	? Time signatures

* Machines :
------------

	* Multiple Inputs/Outputs
	* MIDI generator - instead of generating audio, generates MIDI out - sync could be an issue.
	* Sequencers: Posibility to control more than one machine at the same time
	* Compressor/limiter
	* Flanger/Chorus

* Audio/Control:
----------------

	* ASIO driver I/O
	* audio record support (Like, from microphone)
	* "MIDI Controlling <-> Machine <-> Machine" Interface = MIDI mapping
	  (allow to map midi commands to change different parameters)

	* Ogg/Winamp Plugin export?
