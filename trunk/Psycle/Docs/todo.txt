* velocity should be able to store data to instrument column
! <_sue_> hi...... all those loading/exit/save confirmations are anoying me a bit.....any chance to make 
	them optional in the configs menu? when i start psycle and load a track it even asks me if i want to 
	save the old psy (wich i havent even changed)
	<pooplog> so should the song info popup
* why does it take so long to load a song?
+ make file dialogs remember preferences
+ shift + off inserts an off that does not specify machine
+ option to see waveform instead of notes in pattern editor for acid mode
* clicking on a different block in sequencer should jump play position to it
* psycle default theme sucks (cursor, selection, etc.)
* <_sue_> (autostop) no it also behaves weird with internal delays even if not in record mode....just playng
+ <bohan> hmm, is there a keyb shortcut to seek backs and forwards in a song ? while playing...
* <alk> after I leave a song open for some time, I try and do save and it says "error creating file"
! machine param enter dialog should be modeless
* alk - when opening master dialog [doesn't] centre on mouse?
! alk - make wires square ended, like spec analyser?
* alk - gap in audio when add new machine?
+ alk - mute current track keypress (alt-f9)
+ <pooplog> it would be nice to have an internal wavein machine to get live input <Druttis> Yes
+ <trylle> i mean that it records and plays back at the same time * record wave in too
+ <_sue_> (wire dialog) also i cant use the keyb to set the db level like before (cursor keys)
* <_sue_> the gainer machine doesnt work and the sliders in the minimixer are set to -99
* <_sue_> theres also a strange bug in psycle that it increases/changes param 00 of the vst plug 
	depending on the place where theyr box was placed...
* James says: you have to click on delete connection twice? (in wire dialog)
+ alk-make single click/drag move wire from one machine to another (preserving vol)
+ alk-make wire vol slider more precise (bigger) (it has become less precise)
	pooplog-we should just make a new slider class that uses shift and ctrl like knobs
+ alk-highlight the current line on the linenumbers on the left (so that even if the curson is on the 
	right you can see which line its on)

* Machines
------------
* <Alk^^> bug in pooplog filter see shuffle_me.psy , try muting the sampler (fitler goes to 80% cpu)  
	<ksn> this happens only with moog alp and hp nd xstage phaser filters... 
* <Alk^^> in pooplog filter tweak inertia doesnt work
* cyanphase vibrasynth has an access violation bug
* <_sue_> are there any bugless ported machines? m3 in 22050 mode just makes a click..nothing more....
bug:	 JMDrum is buggy (Crashes sometimes)
* James says: i noticed that the appegiator in the lab causes constant retriggering of VCA
* <mstr_> btw, the xExx command (note cut) has got an issue on your synths, prolly on others, too
	when a value is not set ie 0E00, it mutes all notes
* <alk> in the master the vols dont match up with the wire vol, seems to be 0.1 bigger
* bohan - knowledge: bug arguru_distortion saturator line 92 missing brackets
+ <_sue_> it would be cool if you could give names to the channels in the minimixer
+ <[JAZ]> Internals still miss mouse tweak, right?
* pooplog synths can fuck up vca envelopes somehow weird.

* Sampler Machine/Wave Ed:
--------------------------
* Sample loop not works - is it possible to fix it in next Psycle release?
* {alk} fit sample to match 256 rows (in sampler) doesnt seem to work [JAZ] Are you sure? Code seems OK.
* internal max of 2megs/channel is too small.
bug: 	 portamento to note, slides too much. (can anyone test this for me?)
+ ALK waveed: remove silence from start and end of wave
feature: just have an checkbox to enable or disable the Amplitude, or the whole synthesis (phongshade)
feature: Instruments Support ( *.xi , *.iti, *.sf2. Maybe more)
		 * samples mapped by key
		 * maybe: samples mapped by velocity?
feature: Improve Filter support.
		 * twk Control
		 * maybe: allow filter cutoff/res mapping to velocity
feature: volume slides/arpeggio
feature: better way to set loop points. (+ ping-pong loops)
feature: Easier way to load Samples.
feature: Toolbar for the Wave Editor.
feature: Note playback in WaveEd (Problem: Needs a sampler Machine. The wave preview is not adecuated)

* GUI (pattern):
----------------
*  select with keyboard while playing and follow mode on sucks
* <_sue_> vst tweak rec still stalls...its like it stops follow song... it happens with reFX junox2 it stalls 
	but it recs the tweaks......it just doesnt refresh or something.... with refx junox2 it only shows the 
	rec tweaks when you do a refresh.......like closing the plugs  gui... * the pattern client rect 
	doesn't seem to update when you have the mouse button down on a vst dialog!  repaint messages are lost!!!!!
++ how about option to switch the instrument and machine columns?
+ D says: maybe have some of the effects in a drop down or available by right clicking
+ D says: When you highlight something in Psycle would it be possible to make it so you can drag and 
	drop that highlighted area?
! <_sue_> when on follow song mode play the shift + cursor right and shift + cursor left should work the same 
	way (to navigate in the pattern sequencer).....like hapens on fast tracker 2 .....
! change CUT seq button to DELETE seq button, cut sucks
+ Xerox replace, allow multiple - it replaces the selected pattern(s) with an identical new one
+ Xerox multiple
+ <bdzld> block delete
feature: FT2 Jumps to the top of a pattern when you move from one to another (Kris)
feature: maybe: MultiPattern View (The code is not made in the best way)

* GUI (machines):
-----------------
* <alk> move mouse over vu, black flickering (more noticable on the big vus)* transparent only i think
* alk:  note gets stuck bug, open a machine dialog, play a note, move the machine window, before releasing mouse button  
	release note, then release mouse.
* preview check box in preset dialog stopped working?
* <bdzld> when you put a machine on top of each other, the vus always pop to the top?
* moving machines makes playback pop - machine interface takes too long to redraw, and moving causes redraw
	on every frame
bug:     Crash bug when loading a big .fxb file, problem with deleting, etc...  (Rep. by Vibra)
		 Fix:Basically, make ONLY .fxb for VST's.
! <_sue_> and also being able to select the slot in wich you load a generator.....it goes by defaul to the first 
	not used....sometimes i wanna switch generators and the new one goes to the wrong slot....
! <_sue_> another thing....the lfo knob on your filter should be moving all the time....but it isnt....its only 
	refreshed when it receives tweaks.... <pooplog> it doesn't update knobs unless they are tweaked... then it 
	updates ALL the knobs
+ <_sue_> native mahcines gui should have sliders...it would change a lot.... <pooplog> sliders, switches, and 
	owner draw controls i say?
+ James says: how hard would it be to put nodes in the wires, so you can bend them?
* Saving all the missing settings to registry (like class of plugin..)
feature: Replace Machine by another (right click menu? new button?).
feature: Prevent duplicate names when creating Machines ( FeedMe , FeedMe 2...)
feature: Directories in "Add new machine" (Sorting with directories)
		 Remember previous used and add "class/type" selection to registry
feature: Internal Fx Gui to Native Gui Conversion (including wiredialog)
		 Create a new "universal" MachineFrame class, for all plugins
		 (Needs a few more changes in the class definitions)
feature: VST/Native machine Windows : ESC = close (Problem: can't close within the CWnd!!!)
feature: Option to hide Parameters in VST GUI.
feature: Add Presets in a "tab" under Parameters (easy switching/testing)!

* Player Engine:
----------------
* Midiout is NOT solid...
* <Alk^> do u think the recording with subtracting the buffer delay will be doable? - use fdxx command 
* <sue> playbar should take latency into account - same as ^
* when changing octave, notes playing should be stopped (because if not, notes playing don't stop)
  Problem!!! All key processing is done by InputHandler, so machines don't know when it happens, and neither
             does Inputhandler know which machines are playing. Doing a "player::Stop()" would be a bit hardcore.
			 I agree
bug:	 "MidiInput.cpp(359): warning #68: integer conversion resulted in a change of sign"
bug:	 plugins which make use of the "SaveData" (native) or "SaveChunk" (VST’) can cause a crash if they are
		 missing when you load a song. Won’t get fixed by now. Needs a fileformat change.
bug:	 New Note in Quadrasid does not reinitialize the Envelope. (Bug? This doesn't happen on freebase)
! remove waits from play when in export mode
! longer sequences (256) [file format,maybe others]
! more tracks (64) [file format]
+ <pooplog> again i ask why the connection limit is 12 and not 16 or 24->should use linked lists instead of 
	arrays!!!
+ DirectX effects, intstruments
+ ALK tracker command to bypass an fx, mute command for machines
+ even if it isn't used specifically for volume, there should be a flag to allow machines to recieve command/instrument 
	column data every tick with a SeqTick call (especially useful for effects, which are hurting with only being 
	able to recieve tweaks)
+ option for record to take command FD into account like ft2
feature: Maybe: New command "twc" which will send a machine command (like note delay, to say a silly one)
		 to the machine indicated by gen, and ___>to_the_channel_indicated_by_"inst"<____!
		 (asked by Pikari)
feature: pattern repeat (loop) and song repeat (asked by Vir|us)
feature: tws (Tweak Slide) Command to slide the tweak. (asked by _sue_)
+ new file format: (machines save custom data length, patterns stored according to # tracks, sequence length stored
		according to length, vst multi-out, connections as linked lists, wire nodes, volume column, etc.)

* Vsts:
------------
* <_sue_> but with native intruments pro-52 it doesnt rec the tweaks at all..... <pooplog> are you able to 
	control 	the tweaks of it from the pattern? <_sue_> yes i am (in pro52)
+ <bdzld> which is support for multiout vsti? <pooplog> if psycle was smart enough to detect mutli-out vst, when 
	you drag a wire to it, it could pop up a dialog asking what you ouput want it to connect to - this will 
	require a file format change though :(
! DO NOT LOAD LIST VST list & database
* many vsts freeze the childview from updating while Left mouse button is down, which makes it so pattern does
	not draw, so it appears that tweak recording is not working, such as:
	-juno X2
	-externalizer
	-leveler
	-tools one


* Interface:
------------
* <alk> there's a bug where when u alt-tab the icon is not correct - i cannot find the reason, i checked 
	old versions and they were all like this too...
* <Erodix> theres one little thing.. when psycle is playing and i double-click an song, a new 
	psycle opens..
* Flanger feedback slider
* Instrument filter envelope slider. (check differences with finetune slider)+ midi control commands learn
* <lipid> so is there any way to make 'Delete' an assignable key in the keyboard config?
* <[JAZ]> "fixing" the cache.map file so that it can include dates of dll's and update automatically 
	the info when new one.
* new machine dialog should save preferred sorting method
* should save wire dialog settings
! should make it so clicking on colour boxes pops up menu
! <angelus>What about an option to select the visibility of this pattern-sequence menu. You can hide or show it 
	when you want.
! <pooplog> i mean follow song, multi aud, noteoffs, tweaks, etc. could be buttons perhaps
! record button should set edit mode and follow mode on, should have new export wav button
+ <alk_> the 'Apply' button is not implemented in the config dialog
+ <alk> make it so that you can click anywhere on the wire to get wire vol? (in case triangle is hidden)
+ <[JAZ]> gear rack The description was : " a dialog with 
	a list of machines (from 00: to 7F, that is, Gens and Fx), and buttons of : Add new, remove, swap, 
	exchange, and don't know if anything more... maybe some information (wires used... don't know)
+ <[JAZ]> pooplog : Mmmmm... Seems that the "song modified" code doesn't work now.. (because machine view
	does not track changes yet)
+ <dp|away> you could setup some standard buffers you know are solid and do like setting low -> high 
	and shield the user from the nastiness
+ James says: i have an idea for that actually... seeing as there are so many configurable 
	keys... could perhaps have a textbox, where if you clicked in there, typed a key, it would highlight 
	what was assigned to it
+ <alk> song properties (allow carriage returns, make box bigger?)
+ <alk> be able to save/load key config
+ <_sue_> centering the open file menus....
	and saving theyre size.......i allways have to make them larger so i can browse my samples dir....its 
	convenient for when you have folders with many files as you usually do with samples
+ <doktor1> "how can i make all paterns 128 lenght , not by modifing 1 by 1" -> we should store a default 
	pattern length parameter
+ <Alk^> I also think that the cursor movement after a paste should be optional to =)
+ <_sue_> hey poop....can we have something like a right double click for inserting the first not used pattern
	 (like instert button)?
+ <_sue_> something like selecting a generator and having some global edit functions (in the edit menu :)  
	like :  delete all notes / tranpose all + 12 / delete all tweaks .....stuff like this -> for the entire song
+ songs should save master decrease flag
+ <sue> <pooplog> so please explain to me exactly what sequence mix paste button would do- it would mix-paste data 
	into the currently selected blocks? <sue> yes it would work as pattern mix paste for more than one pattern.
+ <sue> hotkeys for seq edit cut, copy, paste, etc?
feature: MORE Keyboard shortcuts 

* Driver Issues:
------------
* Output gets weird after a bit and start playing all crackly and doubletime
  <[JAZ]> I've seen this bug only when playing a song, going to configure the output and accepting
   in the "waveout" or "Directsound" box. When accepting in the config dialog, all is back to normal.
bug:	 DirectSound Output is a bit buggy.Crashes and bad sound reported. 
+ ASIO? LegoStar has it working....

* Importing:
------------
bug: It doesn't add the machines necessary to play all notes.
bug: if you import an XM file and save, the finetune of the samples is not saved (Fileformat limitation)
feature: Add option for the user to create samplers for instruments
feature: IT importing
+ .mid import
+ Import machines from song - the (regular) .psy is loaded without erasing the already loaded song ignoring 
	pattern data and other settings, this possible? (yes, but will require new song parser...)










-- Possible Features For Psycle 2 --
------------------------------------

-----------------------
	* Multi pattern Sequencing
	* Multiple Editors (Not only tracker view)
	* Parameter Automation  ( Envelopes for Parameters )
	* Velocity/Panning/other_weird column to pattern data
	* Appregiator: One "template" note, notes "produced" by the appregiator in a different colour.
	* "zip"-able columns.

	? Maybe notes/etc, of muted machines shown in grey
	? Time signatures

* Machines :
------------

* Audio/Control:
----------------

	* ASIO driver I/O
