* Other crap
------------
<Alk^^> bug in pooplog filter see shuffle_me.psy , try muting the sampler (fitler goes to 80% cpu)
<Alk^^> in pooplog filter tweak inertia doesnt work

* Sampler Machine/Wave Ed:
--------------------------
bug: 	 portamento to note, slides too much. (can anyone test this for me?)
+ ALK waveed: remove silence from start and end of wave
feature: just have an checkbox to enable or disable the Amplitude, or the whole synthesis (phongshade)
feature: Instruments Support ( *.xi , *.iti, *.sf2. Maybe more)
		 * samples mapped by key
		 * maybe: samples mapped by velocity?
feature: Improve Filter support.
		 * twk Control
		 * maybe: allow filter cutoff/res mapping to velocity
feature: volume slides/arpeggio
feature: better way to set loop points. (+ ping-pong loops)
feature: Easier way to load Samples.
feature: Toolbar for the Wave Editor.
feature: Note playback in WaveEd (Problem: Needs a sampler Machine. The wave preview is not adecuated)

* GUI (pattern):
----------------
**  select with keyboard while playing and follow mode on sucks
* <bdzld> block double should be contrained to block
* <sue> when pressing enter on a generator tweak, the generator number is captured, but that doesnt happen if  
	you press enter on an effect tweak. <_sue_> the first point in my txt is not true.....enter captures 
	native fx tweaks.....and even vsts fx tweaks.....but it doesnt shows it in the pull down menu (only in vsts)
* <_sue_> vst tweak rec still stalls...its like it stops follow song... it happens with reFX junox2 it stalls 
	but it recs the tweaks......it just doesnt refresh or something.... with refx junox2 it only shows the 
	rec tweaks when you do a refresh.......like closing the plugs  gui... 
++ how about option to switch the instrument and machine columns?
! <_sue_> when on follow song mode play the shift + cursor right and shift + cursor left should work the same 
	way (to navigate in the pattern sequencer).....like hapens on fast tracker 2 .....
! change CUT seq button to DELETE seq button, cut sucks
! <_sue_> the pattern sequencer "mini" window could really be longer.....depending on windows screen res....in 
	the one im using i have half of the tab where the pattern seq is completely free.
+ Xerox replace, allow multiple - it replaces the selected pattern(s) with an identical new one
+ Xerox multiple
+ <bdzld> block delete
feature: FT2 Jumps to the top of a pattern when you move from one to another (Kris)
feature: maybe: MultiPattern View (The code is not made in the best way)
feature: MORE Keyboard shortcuts 
feature: First, I'd like to see the Generator or Effect name in one of these places
		 when I hover over a note in the Pattern Editor ( MrToast )

* GUI (machines):
-----------------
* alk:  note gets stuck bug, open a machine dialog, play a note, move the machine window, before releasing mouse button  
	release note, then release mouse.
* preview check box in preset dialog stopped working?
* <bdzld> when you put a machine on top of each other, the vus always pop to the top?
* dragging machines is not always the greatest pleasure of all. *** the other day it was being weird but today 
	it is fine.  i think it has to do with cpu load.
bug:     Crash bug when loading a big .fxb file, problem with deleting, etc...  (Rep. by Vibra)
		 Fix:Basically, make ONLY .fxb for VST's.
bug:	 JMDrum is buggy (Crashes sometimes)
! <_sue_> and also being able to select the slot in wich you load a generator.....it goes by defaul to the first 
	not used....sometimes i wanna switch generators and the new one goes to the wrong slot....
! <_sue_> another thing....the lfo knob on your filter should be moving all the time....but it isnt....its only 
	refreshed when it receives tweaks.... <pooplog> it doesn't update knobs unless they are tweaked... then it 
	updates ALL the knobs
+ <_sue_> native mahcines gui should have sliders...it would change a lot.... <pooplog> sliders, switches, and 
	owner draw controls i say?
+ What if master machine looked like a mixer and you could double click it to bring up not only the master volume,
	but labelled volume sliders for each of the machines connected to it? -> this would suck as you would get names
	for only the effects
+ ALK You may have coinsidered this already, making machines have a right click menu (from the 
	machines view) with one of the items benig duplicate machine.
+ how about nice looking bmp windows for machine link and master machine dialogs?
*: Saving all the missing settings to registry (like class of plugin..)
feature: Clone Machine Button
feature: Replace Machine by another.
feature: Prevent duplicate names when creating Machines ( FeedMe , FeedMe 2...)
feature: Directories in "Add new machine" (Sorting with directories)
		 Remember previous used and add "class/type" selection to registry
feature: Internal Fx Gui to Native Gui Conversion (including wiredialog)
		 Create a new "universal" MachineFrame class, for all plugins
		 (Needs a few more changes in the class definitions)
feature: VST/Native machine Windows : ESC = close (Problem: can't close within the CWnd!!!)
feature: Option to hide Parameters in VST GUI.
feature: Add Presets in a "tab" under Parameters (easy switching/testing)!
feature: Really good looking new Master Machine.(Graphics under res\MasterMachine)


* Player Engine:
----------------
* <Alk^> do u think the recording with subtracting the buffer delay will be doable? 
* song length calculation does not take ffxx/fexx commands into account
* changing octave, make notes stop (because if not, notes playing don't stop)
bug:	 In some rare cases, when opening a song, psycle produces noise. (See "fly to the moon [non vocal].psy")
		 When opening it, a noise is produced by one machine and passed to the others. The bug doesn't happen
		 when debugging!
bug:	 "MidiInput.cpp(359): warning #68: integer conversion resulted in a change of sign"
bug:	 plugins which make use of the "SaveData" (native) or "SaveChunk" (VST’) can cause a crash if they are
		 missing when you load a song. Won’t get fixed by now. Needs a fileformat change.
bug:	 New Note in Quadrasid does not reinitialize the Envelope. (Bug? This doesn't happen on freebase)
! remove waits from play when in export mode
! longer sequences (256) [file format,maybe others]
! more tracks (64) [file format]
+ ALK tracker command to bypass an fx, mute command for machines
+ even if it isn't used specifically for volume, there should be a flag to allow machines to recieve command/instrument 
	column data every tick with a SeqTick call (especially useful for effects, which are hurting with only being 
	able to recieve tweaks)
+ option for record to take command FD into account like ft2
feature: Maybe: New command "twc" which will send a machine command (like note delay, to say a silly one)
		 to the machine indicated by gen, and ___>to_the_channel_indicated_by_"inst"<____!
		 (asked by Pikari)
feature: pattern repeat (loop) and song repeat (asked by Vir|us)
feature: tws (Tweak Slide) Command to slide the tweak. (asked by _sue_)
+ new file format: (machines save custom data length, patterns stored according to # tracks, sequence length stored
		according to length, vst multi-out, etc.)

* Vsts:
------------
* <_sue_> but with native intruments pro-52 it doesnt rec the tweaks at all..... <pooplog> are you able to 
	control 	the tweaks of it from the pattern? <_sue_> yes i am (in pro52)
+ <bdzld> which is support for multiout vsti? <pooplog> if psycle was smart enough to detect mutli-out vst, when 
	you drag a wire to it, it could pop up a dialog asking what you ouput want it to connect to - this will 
	require a file format change though :(
! DO NOT LOAD LIST VST list & database

* Interface:
------------
* <Erodix> theres one little thing.. when psycle is playing and i double-click an song, a new 
	psycle opens..
* <sue> when selecting vsts the midi/params/waves pull down menu should go automaticly to "params" (this already 
	happens to native plugs)
* Flanger feedback slider
* Instrument filter envelope slider. (check differences with finetune slider)+ midi control commands learn
! Have exit warning on modified file
! should make it so clicking on colour boxes pops up menu
! <angelus>What about an option to select the visibility of this pattern-sequence menu. You can hide or show it 
	when you want.
! <pooplog> i mean follow song, multi aud, noteoffs, tweaks, etc. could be buttons perhaps
! record button should set edit mode and follow mode on, should have new export wav button
+ actual skinning
+ visual preset saving/loading
+ <doktor1> "how can i make all paterns 128 lenght , not by modifing 1 by 1" -> we should store a default 
	pattern length parameter
+ <Alk^> I also think that the cursor movement after a paste should be optional to =)
+ Alk* would be useful to put dialogs like wire vol into separate tasks (modeless) so psycle is not disabled 
	when they are open
+ <_sue_> hey poop....can we have something like a right double click for inserting the first not used pattern
	 (like instert button)?
+ <_sue_> something like selecting a generator and having some global edit functions (in the edit menu :)  
	like :  delete all notes / tranpose all + 12 / delete all tweaks .....stuff like this -> for the entire song
+ pooplog - dragging files onto psycle window would be nice, hmm?
+ songs should save master decrease flag
+ <sue>in the plugs gui: control + left mouse button on a knob to capture respective param in the pulldown menu 
	(many vsts use control + left mouse button to reset knobs/params....maybe any other alike key 
	combination.... )
+ <sue> <pooplog> so please explain to me exactly what sequence mix paste button would do- it would mix-paste data 
	into the currently selected blocks? <sue> yes it would work as pattern mix paste for more than one pattern.
+ <sue> hotkeys for seq edit cut, copy, paste, etc?

* Driver Issues:
------------
* moving machines makes playback pop
* Output gets weird after a bit and start playing all crackly and doubletime
  <[JAZ]> I've seen this bug only when playing a song, going to configure the output and accepting
   in the "waveout" or "Directsound" box. When accepting in the config dialog, all is back to normal.
bug:	 DirectSound Output is a bit buggy.Crashes and bad sound reported. 
+ ASIO?

* Importing:
------------
bug: It doesn't add the machines necessary to play all notes.
bug: if you import an XM file and save, the finetune of the samples is not saved (Fileformat limitation)
feature: Add option for the user to create samplers for instruments
feature: IT importing
+ Import machines from song - the (regular) .psy is loaded without erasing the already loaded song ignoring 
	pattern data and other settings, this possible? (yes, but will require new song parser...)










-- Possible Features For Psycle 2 --
------------------------------------

* Editing Capabilities:
-----------------------
	* Multi pattern Sequencing
	* Multiple Editors (Not only tracker view)
	* Parameter Automation  ( Envelopes for Parameters )
	* Velocity/Panning/other_weird column to pattern data
	* Appregiator: One "template" note, notes "produced" by the appregiator in a different colour.
	* "zip"-able columns.
	* Tracker track? (for bpm, global volume...)
	? Notes of current selected machine marked with a different colour
	? Maybe notes/etc, of muted machines shown in grey
	? Time signatures

* Machines :
------------

	* Multiple Inputs/Outputs
	* MIDI generator - instead of generating audio, generates MIDI out - sync could be an issue.
	* Sequencers: Posibility to control more than one machine at the same time
	* Compressor/limiter
	* Flanger/Chorus

* Audio/Control:
----------------

	* ASIO driver I/O
