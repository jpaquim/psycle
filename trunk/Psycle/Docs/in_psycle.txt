\/ Description
---------------

	This Plugin allows you to play .psy files containing Psycle Songs.

	It is based on the source code of Psycle 1.7.
	It is faster than psycle (since this code doesn't calculate the CPU usage
	nor the vumeters) but with winamp's eq and vis, it can become slower.

	On a side note:
	---------------
	Winamp GENERIC EQ destroys high frequencies as reported for other plugin developers.

	If you want to see/hear it, connect the eq, put it on zero (all frequencies as well
	as the PreAmp). In this position, the eq is internally disabled by winamp.
	Now, move any slider a little up or down and you'll hear the big difference in the
	high spectrum (and you'll be able to see it in the Vis as well).


\/ Limitations
---------------

	This version of the plugin has the following limitations:

	· Not exact duration and/or seeking with songs that use FFxx or FExx commands.
	· Cannot save the info.
	· Maybe others that I can't think of right now.


\/ Version Revision
--------------------

1.0 RC 1 (25-12-2002)
--------------------
·Fixed some problems with playing some songs.
·Some small changes in the info dialog.


Beta 6 (10-12-2002)
--------------------
·Engine Update to Psycle 1.7
·Added configuration Dialog
·Added Info dialog
·Fixed the "winamp refreshing always" problem.
·Linked to MFC statically (hence the increase of size). Should
 add for stability. Most of the code doesn't need it so it might
 be possible in the future to remove MFC completely.


Beta 5 (??-09-2002)
--------------------
·Engine Update to Psycle 1.66


Beta 4 (30-03-2002)
--------------------
·Engine Update to Psycle 1.6Plus


Beta 4 (20-03-2002)
--------------------
·Engine Update to Psycle 1.6Final
·Source Code shared between the Plugin and the Tracker.


Beta 3 (12-12-2001)
--------------------
·Engine Update to Psycle 1.6 RC1
·Now it unloads the song when it finishes (frees memory)

Beta 2 (13-06-2001)
--------------------
·Engine Update to Psycle 1.5 b3 R5

Beta 1 (30-05-2001)
