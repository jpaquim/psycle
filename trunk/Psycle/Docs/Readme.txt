1. About PSYCLE:


PSYCLE is a free OpenSource Music Production Studio,
that offers unlimited (opinions may vary) possibilites
for creating your own music in a professional way. 

PSYCLE has an Old-School Tracker interface, but it 
supports VST Plugins and VST Instruments in addition
to samples, to let your wildest music ideas come true.

Here some facts about Psycle:

- 32 Tracks Pattern Editor (this limitation will be removed in the future)
- Stereo Sampler unit, that supports high quality
  stereo .wav files and .iff samples as well (more formats will eventually come)
- 8 internal Plugins (Sampler & Effects)
- 20+ Native Plugins (Generators & effects)
- VST + VSTi Host (still limited but most plugins will work fine)
- Internal .wav output
- Configurable Keyboard Layout
- .fxb loading for VST's
- Midi-In Support

and much much more...

If you need help starting with Psycle, please, check the "Docs" section at
 __Psycledelics site__ (official Psycle Users Site)

  http://psycle.pastnotecut.org/

  or its mirror at: http://psycle.project-psy.com/


Note:
Psycle supports VST1.0 and VST2.0 plugins, but not completely (Some plugins will not work)
Plans for supporting DXi are there, but it's not a primary work.

2. OpenSource Notes:

PSYCLE is OpenSource. This Means: Everyone who thinks that he's the right person/alien
for coding on PSYCLE can contact the Team of developers and ask/tell what he
can do for Psycle.

Source Page is set at SourceForge site following this link:

	http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/psycle


Arguru Licensed Psycle 1.0 sources as "Public Domain".
This means that the sources of Psycle can be used in whatever form you want.

This licensing applies ONLY to his sources, which day by day are less and less.


The current team preffers to enforce that psycle sources remain Free to everyone, which
means everyone can see and modify the source, but If he does it, he cannot distribute them
in a closed way.

He might, on the other hand, distrubute them as his own work, specifying that it
is A DERIVED WORK FROM PSYCLE


Also, the team would appreciate that any work done over Psycle sources, are mixed back with
the current sources, which would mean that Psycle grows instead of being divided.

There are open Forums and Bug trackers in SourceForge site and in Psycledelics site
where you can contact us.

If you need to contact specifically the developers, write an e-mail to

	[JAZ] at jaz@pastnotecut.org for that matter.


You are allowed to develop psycle Machines without any restriction 
There's no SDK ready, but you can download Psycle plugins' sourcecode from 
SourceForge Site (link above)

A Buzz2Psycle SDK is avaiable at the site, but it is untested.
Hint: Check M3 sources too, which are derived from a buzz plugin.

Sources for a Fast sinus calculation used in the Flanger are extracted from

	http://www.musicdsp.org/

3. Development:

Psycle 1:
	It is still alive. This version confirms it. Much more will come in the following
	months, as long as the dev. team has time.

	Next major steps will be : Multipattern sequence, mutisample instrument sampler
				   and new fileformat.


For up to date information, don't forget to visit the Developement forums on Psycledelics 
site.
