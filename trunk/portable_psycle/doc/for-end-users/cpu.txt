The pack contains the "doc" dir,
and directories containing the binaries themselves,
of the psycle host application, and all the open source native plugins.

All binaries come currently in two versions, one for each CPU type. Both are included in the pack:

	- G7:
		- G7-SSE: Athlon XP, late Duron, Pentium 4, Celeron Pentium 4, Pentium M Centrino, Athlon 64, Athlon FX
		- G7: Athlon and early Duron.

	- G6:
		- G6-SSE: Pentium III and Celeron Pentium III.
		- G6: Pentium Pro, Pentium II, and early Celeron.

Currently, we don't distribute builds for older cpus, G5: Pentium, K6, K6-2, K6-III, 5x86, 6x86, etc.
If you request us to add it, we'll add it.
At the time of this writing, AMD Athlon 64/FX and Intel IA-64 are not yet widely used,
and we don't have tools to make builds for these CPUs.
