This is "portable" in that it's iso c++,
or, at least the syntax is understood by both gcc and msvc 7.1.
(This means the source code in this directory is not compilable under msvc 6, which is not iso compliant.)

===================
directory structure
===================

	include/: public headers of third party libraries
	src/: sources (*.cpp), private headers (*.private.hpp), and public headers (*.hpp) of this package
		project.private.hpp: private header #included by all source files (*.cpp) to centralize compiler tweaking
		project.hpp: public version of the project.private.hpp private header that can be #included by other public headers.
		precompiled_headers.private.hpp: private header included by project.private.hpp (and hence all source files) that #include what is precompiled
		psycle/:
			host/: psycle host
			plugins/: psycle plugins
	make/: build systems for various compilers (only msvc so far!)
		msvc_7.1/: solution and project files for msvc 7.1
		msvc_8.0/: solution and project files for msvc 8.0
			solution.sln: solution (.sln) file
			projects/: project (.vcproj) files (note that these projects are set up so that pathes to source files and header files are relative to the solution file)
			output/*/: output files produced by the various config of the projects (not included in the cvs)
				intermediate/: intermediate files (.pch, .obj, .ilk, .idb, ...) produced during compilation (not included in the cvs)
				lib/: .lib and .exp files (not included in the cvs)
				bin/: .dll and .exe (and .pdb) files (not included in the cvs)
