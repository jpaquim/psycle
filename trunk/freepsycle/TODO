# This is a sorted list, top priority at the top!

*	generic::port::connect move to generic::base::port

*	generic::wrappers::node find port by name functions

*	om-synth at savannah

*	make psycleMFC's src/psycle/plugin.hpp more readable by
	defining the nested classes outside their enclosing class,
	leaving only a forward declaration in the enclosing class.
	as in:
		class enclosing
		{
			class nested;
		};
		class enclosing::nested
		{
			...
		};
	I've tested it on gcc, i hope msvc7.1 won't choke on it.
