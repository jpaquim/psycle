*	The math routines that map to C99 functions should be named the same,
	e.g. the functions "rounded", "truncated", "remained", etc should be named like in C99.

*	Boost provides implementation of some C99 functions for msvc,
	but we need to upgrade the boost version for msvc2005 in the external-packages dir.

*	liboil provides some interesting optimised routines
