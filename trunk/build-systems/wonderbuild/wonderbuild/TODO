* --help shouldn't create the build dir.

* need a way to select a script from the command line instead of just a source dir (via --src-dir).

* integrate binreloc.

* versionned libs; also take care of relinking clients of shared libs when their version changed.

* rewrite colorgcc in python; low priority, since clang already has colors natively.

* experiment with beta-mode like tup.

* speedup boost lib detection : try multiple link names in parallel and don't #include

* FHS and multiarch: automatically choose lib dir according to compiler target arch-kernel-os triplet, e.g. <prefix>/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
