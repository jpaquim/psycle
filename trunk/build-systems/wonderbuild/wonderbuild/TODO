* #include scanner for msvc: cl.exe -showincludes

* --help shouldn't create the build dir.

* need a way to select a script from the command line instead of just a source dir (via --src-dir).

* integrate binreloc.

* versionned libs; also take care of relinking clients of shared libs when their version changed.

* rewrite colorgcc in python; low priority, since clang already has colors natively.

* experiment with beta-mode like tup.
