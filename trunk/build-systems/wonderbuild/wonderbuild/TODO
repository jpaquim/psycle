* When a dependent module is built locally, if the include path prepends the source dir of that module,
  it would allow for build errors to print the path of the original sources instead of the staged-installed ones.
  This would avoid the user to have to translate the path to correct the original source file.
  e.g.: build error in ../../staged-install/usr/local/include/xxx instead of xxx/src/xxx.

* --help shouldn't create the build dir.

* need a way to select a script from the command line instead of just a source dir (via --src-dir).

* integrate binreloc.

* generate .pc files.

* versionned libs; also take care of relinking clients of shared libs when their version changed.

* rewrite colorgcc in python; low priority, since clang already has colors natively.

* experiment with beta-mode like tup.
