* concatenate all the compiler checks about predefined macros into one, including the version.
  already done for the binary format check, just need to put all the rest here.

* when a loadable module depends on a lib, that lib can't be a non-pic one.

* --help shouldn't create the build dir.

* need a way to select a script from the command line, instead of --src-dir.

* standard flags flavors for debug, release, and strip.

* cannot test tty on jython.

* integrate binreloc.

* rewrite colorgcc in python.

* generate .pc files.

* only the top-level script should have default tasks.

* c lang support.

* don't make target_dir methods depend on target methods, but rather the reverse, so that users may choose to "install" to another dir
  This has impact on the impl classes, where --rpath, --rpath-link, and -L flags use fhs.lib

* versionned libs.

* the <class>.shared functions should allow to share an instance at other levels than the project.

* some mecanism to set default values for options is needed.

* review the messages printed when a required dep isn't available.
	wonderbuild: failed: deps of module ++wonderbuild/staged-install/usr/local/bin/psycle-player.exe
		requires the following dep: deps of module ++wonderbuild/staged-install/usr/local/bin/psycle-core.dll
	wonderbuild: failed: deps of module /cygdrive/x/sf/psycle-cygwin/trunk/build-systems/++wonderbuild/staged-install/usr/local/bin/psycle-core.dll
		requires the following dep: check pkg-config --exists libxml++-2.6


* either add some --recheck option and detect fine-grain external libs/progs changes:
	- find prog abs paths via the PATH env var.
	- build checks should include headers in the sig (doable on gcc).
	- pkg-config needs the --rechecks option.
