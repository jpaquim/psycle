* when a loadable module depends on a lib, that lib can't be a non-pic one.

* --help shouldn't create the build dir.

* need a way to select a script from the command line, instead of --src-dir.

* standard flags flavors for debug, release, and strip.

* cannot test tty on jython (should look at the underlying platform hidden behind the jvm).

* integrate binreloc.

* rewrite colorgcc in python.

* generate .pc files.

* only the top-level script should have default tasks.

* c lang support.

* don't make target_dir methods depend on target methods, but rather the reverse, so that users may choose to "install" to another dir
  This has impact on the impl classes, where --rpath, --rpath-link, and -L flags use fhs.lib

* versionned libs.

* the <class>.shared functions should allow to share an instance at other levels than the project.

* add some --recheck option and detect fine-grain external libs/progs changes:
	- find prog abs paths via the PATH env var.
	- build checks should include headers in the sig (doable on gcc).
	- pkg-config needs the --rechecks option.

* the path to colorgcc shouldn't be signed, but rather the path to the real compiler.
  this stupidly triggers rebuild when changing from non-tty to tty or vice versa.
