				<a href='./debian/dists/source/unstable/main/source/Sources.gz'>source packages</a>.
				<br/>
				You can choose either <code>unstable</code>, <code>testing</code> or <code>stable</code> <b>for the version of psycle</b>,
				Note that this is independent from the main debian distribution you use:
				All packages are built on debian <code>unstable</code>, debian <code>testing</code>, debian <code>stable</code>, ubuntu <code>dapper</code>, ubuntu <code>breezy</code>, etc ...
				<br/>
				In the following <b>example</b>, <code>etch/unstable</code> means psycle's <code>unstable</code> version for the debian <code>etch</code> distibution.
				<br/>
				To let APT find the archive and look into it for psycle <code>unstable</code> binary packages compiled for the <code>etch</code> debian distribution,
				add <b>for example (see notes above)</b> following lines to your <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>:
				<div class='indented'>
					<code>
						# psycle binary packages
						<br/>
						deb http://psycle.sourceforge.net/debian etch/unstable main
					</code>
				</div>
				Then, update you local list of packages:
				<div class='indented'>
					<code>
						apt-get update
					</code>
				</div>
				and do a search for 'psycle' with your favorite package tool, for example:
				<div class='indented'>
					<code>
						apt-cache search psycle
					</code>
				</div>
				or,
				<div class='indented'>
					<code>
						dpkg --list '*psycle*'
					</code>
				</div>
				If you want to install all psycle binary packages,
				install the <code>psycle</code> package
				which is a pseudo package with dependencies on all psycle packages:
				<div class='indented'>
					<code>
						apt-get install psycle
					</code>
				</div>
				Note:
				<div class='indented'>
					Currently, the archive contains binaries only for the <code>i386</code> architecture.
					You can easily build the source packages to produce binary packages for your architecture.
					<br/>
					For each source package, there are three versions: <code>unstable</code>, <code>testing</code>, <code>stable</code>
					<br/>
					To let APT find the source archive and look into it for <code>unstable</code> source packages,

			<part caption='Microsoft&apos;s Windows&#174;&#8482;'>
				This is probably the most painful operating system for software distribution,
				as it doesn't come with any standard system for
				distributing packages,
				automatically resolving/downloading their dependencies,
				and with consistent versions accross all packages installed system-wide,
				or at least support for multiple versions simultaneously installed.
				(This operating system is not a distribution, it's both proprietary and anarchic).
				<br/>
				This means we have to track all psycle's dependencies and bundle them
				into a custom, giant, monolithic "package",
				which is self-contained and not meant to be installed system-wide,
				but rather, locally in each user's home dir.
				This makes the "package" very big (it's a mini distro itself),
				but works around all the defficiencies mentionned above.

					For each source package, there are three versions: <code>unstable</code>, <code>testing</code>, <code>stable</code>

						<code>
							# psycle source packages

						<code>
							cd /tmp

							apt-get source psycle

					Building the source package requires that you have some other packages installed,

				Psycle's source package uses the GNU build system (autoconf, automake, libtool, pkg-config).
				You don't need to have these tools installed but pkg-config.
				Also, you will need to have a c++ compiler, linker, make, and the development files of the libraries psycle depends on.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				On debian, you can tell APT to download and install these dependency packages by issuing the following command:
				<div class='indented'>
					<code>
						apt-get build-dep psycle
					</code>
				</div>
				On other systems, to view the dependencies, read the file
				<a href='./debian/dists/source/unstable/main/source/Sources.gz'/> for the latest unstable version of the source package, or
				the file <code>psycle_*.*.*.dsc</code> in the <a href='./debian/'/> directory for a particular version of the source package.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				The GNU build system follows the standard two-step build procedure of unices source packages:
				<ol>
					<li>
						<code>configure</code>:
						detection of system characteristics, and configuration of the build options
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>make</code>:
						execution of the make files which describe the actual build commands as configured in the previous step
						(compilation, linking, moving of files to installation destination)
					</li>
				</ol>
				You can also build from within the IDE of your choice.
				<part caption='Building from a GNU system for the same GNU system' anchor='build'>

							cd psycle-*
							<br/>

							make install-strip
							<br/>
							cd ../psycle-install-dir
							<br/>
							tree
							<br/>
							./bin/psycle
						</code>
					</div>
					You can also simply use the script named <code>./packageneric/generic/bin/build</code> which comes with the source package and does
					the <code>mkdir &amp;&amp; cd</code>, <code>configure</code> and <code>make</code> steps.
